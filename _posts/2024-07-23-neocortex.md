Columns extract relevant information in determining and distinguishing patterns.

The neocortex is a cerebral structure which takes inputs from the rest of the brain. Its evolutionary purpose is to develop more complex relationships between sensory data, rewards, etc. It doesn't directly control muscles, instead it learns patterns and sequences that are sent to subcortical structures (like the cerebellum for muscle movement). These subcortical structures then take the sequence and combinations of firing patterns and trigger muscles.

The neocortex's job is to learn models of its input. Sub cortical structures relay information to the neocortex which memorizes, learns complex computations, etc. The neocortex doesn't directly learn to optimize behaviors. Subcortical structures establish connections to the neocortex, which learns, for example, how combination of behaviors, sensory input, and rewards, are associated. A larger neocortex means a larger surface area means more cortical columns which means more layered, nuanced, and complex patterns that can be recognized. Humans reached the point where more cortical columns can be assigned to metacognition, which I believe spiralled the development of humans.

Current AI models learn models of their environment. But they are forced into highly specialized, single traffic pathways, as opposed to the proliferous connection of neocortical columns.

Structures of the brain more critical for survival have fewer connections to the neocortex (I'm guessing)

A common theme in the cortical layers is inhibitory neurons non-specifically connecting to neurons within their layer. This is perhaps to encourage confidence in firing of neural subnetworks. Neurons compute with frequency and probability and these inhibitory connections repeatedly collapse the potential ideas represented by subnetworks into a single one, on which to do further computations.

Consciousness is tied with meta cognition. To be able to experience the world, see it, etc. allows to be able to reflect on that experience, learn from it, and make actions based on it. Attention is the brains ability to limit experience to a subset of sensory input. The thalamus plays a role, allows, for example, novel stimuli to redirect attention.

? Why does pyramidal neuron size matter with layers
- Only and all mammals have a neocortex. Mammals differ a lot in brain structure, but the structure of the neocortex remains fairly consistent.
- Newest part of the cerebral cortex to evolve hence the prefix neo meaning new
- Statistics
    - In the macaque monkey, there are roughly $1x10^6$ geniculate relay cells while there are $1.6x10^8$ primary visual cortex neurons.

# Cells
[Neuron]
Betz cell, Pyramidal cell, and Stellate cell

# Function
- Subnetworks
    - Excitatory pyramidal neurons are connected to inhibitory stellate neurons and form recurrent connections with other pyramidal neurons. This forms a collection of subnetworks where one neuron excites all others in the subnetwork, while inhibiting other subnetworks. Recurrent connections allow the subnetwork to overcome inhibitory stellate neurons. Form an equivalence class. Each subnetwork represents an idea.
    - Stellate neurons provide an inhibitory blanket.
    - The subnetworks essentially form another layer, representing another neuron. However it doesn't have weights, but instead acts as an OR operation on neurons in the subnetwork.
    ? Why is this useful
        - Allows multiple networks within a cortical column
        - Allows column to change the function it performs
        - Allows high-level conscious control
    - Formed through synaptic plasticity

# Layers
- Divided into six layers, labelled from outswards to inwards I-VI
- Consists of gray matter, or unmylinated neurons surrounding the cerebrum
- A species of oceanic dolphin has the most neocortical neurons
- 80% excitatory and 20% inhibitory neurons
<- := Afferent
-> := Efferent
- I think information essentially starts at layer IV, gets processes, sent to the thalamus, then information is sent back to layers I, II, III to perform high-level cognitive functions on layer IV

There is considerable feedback and lateral connectivity in the neocortex.

Certainly, let's delve into the connectivity of each neocortical layer, including their primary inputs and outputs and the nature of those connections (excitatory or inhibitory).

L4 and L6‚Çê exhibit simple receptive fields while L23 and L5 exhibit complex receptive fields. L23 have receptive fields twice the size of L4 in the primary somatosensory cortex [Chapin 1986].

Layer I (Molecular Layer):
Inputs: Receives afferent connections mainly from the thalamocortical and corticocortical fibers that synapse onto the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons extending into this layer. The inputs are primarily excitatory.
Outputs: Primarily provides modulatory signals to the dendrites of neurons in the layers below. These connections are generally excitatory, involving glutamatergic synapses.
Neurons: Sparse population of neurons, mostly Cajal-Retzius cells, and stellate cells.
Function: Modulates synaptic activity, integrates inputs from various sources.
Connectivity: Receives inputs from other cortical areas, especially from the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in deeper layers. It also receives some thalamocortical input and has horizontal connections within the layer.
- Few neurons
- Transverse fibers
<- Thalamus (matrix type thalamus cells)
- Apical denditric tufts of pyramidal neurons
- Horizontally oriented axons
- Glial cells
- Some spiny stellate cells
- Inputs to apical tufts are believed to be important for the feedback interactions in the cerebral cortex involved in associative learning and attention
- Receives substantial input from matrix or M-type thalamus cells (in contrast to C-type thalamus cells)

Layer II (External Granular Layer):
Inputs: Receives inputs from layer III pyramidal cells, other cortical areas (corticocortical projections), and the thalamus. These connections are mostly excitatory.
Outputs: Sends excitatory outputs to layer III and other cortical areas, including feedback to the thalamus.
Connectivity: Contains mainly intracortical connections, connecting with layers III and IV. Some cells project to other cortical areas.
Neurons: Predominantly small stellate and pyramidal cells.
Function: Plays a role in intracortical communication and processing local information.
- Many stellate neurons
- Small pyramidal neurons

Layer III (External Pyramidal Layer):
Inputs: Gathers inputs from layer IV stellate cells, layer II neurons, and corticocortical afferents from other cortical areas. These are primarily excitatory connections.
Outputs: Projects excitatory outputs to other cortical areas (both within the same hemisphere and to the contralateral hemisphere via the corpus callosum), as well as to layer V within the same cortical area.
Connectivity: Neurons project to other cortical areas, both within the same hemisphere (associational fibers) and to the contralateral hemisphere (commissural fibers, via the corpus callosum). It also has connections with layer V.
Neurons: Mainly medium-sized pyramidal cells and some stellate cells.
Function: Important for inter-area communication and integration of information.
- Small and medium pyramidal neurons
-> Coticocortical
- Main target of interhemispheric corticocortical afferents

Layer IV (Internal Granular Layer):
Inputs: Primarily receives sensory input from the thalamus (thalamocortical fibers), which are excitatory. It is the main recipient of sensory information, acting as a relay to the other cortical layers.
Outputs: Sends excitatory outputs to layers II, III, and V, facilitating the flow of sensory information up the cortical hierarchy.
Connectivity: Receives the main sensory input from the thalamus, particularly in sensory areas of the cortex, and has connections with layers II, III, and V.
Neurons: Primarily stellate cells, with a few pyramidal cells.
Function: Processes incoming sensory information before sending it to other layers.
- Receives input from C-type thalamus cells
- Stellate and pyramidal cells
- Stellate cells are most common here
<- Thalamus (core type thalamus cells)
- Line of Gennari is due to dense axonal input from the thalamus to IV of visual cotex

Layer V (Internal Pyramidal Layer):
Inputs: Receives inputs from layers II and III, as well as from the thalamus. These connections are excitatory.
Outputs: Generates outputs to various subcortical structures such as the striatum, brainstem, and spinal cord, which are excitatory and critical for initiating motor actions. It also sends excitatory projections back to layers II and III and to the thalamus (forming corticothalamic pathways).
Connectivity: Contains large pyramidal neurons, including Betz cells in the motor cortex, which send long-range projections to subcortical structures such as the striatum, brainstem, and spinal cord. It also has intracortical connections and sends outputs to layers II and III.
Neurons: Large pyramidal neurons and some stellate cells.
Function: Involved in sending motor commands and in forming subcortical projections.
- Scattered betz cells (large pyramidal cells)
- Leave the cortex and connect with subcortical structures such as the basal ganglia
-> Corticocortical, Subcortical structures
The reason LV projects to motor regions is because the brain is fundamentally in a physical world and needs to be deciding what physical actions to take as well as understand how those actions relate to rewards. This allows individual columns direct movement for important stimuli.
I don't think this is true: perhaps the projections to motor regions results in path integration, maybe uses these subcortical structures to generalize movements in some abstract space, the neuron could connect with this in such a way to establish a meaning of movement and reward with how it connects to less abstract parts of the brain. Except that it doesn't necessarily receive input from those systems back.

Layer VI (Multiform Layer):
Inputs: Gathers inputs from layer IV and the thalamus, with the thalamic inputs being primarily excitatory. It also receives feedback from higher cortical areas.
Outputs: Mainly projects back to the thalamus, forming part of the corticothalamic loop, with these projections being excitatory. It also sends connections to other cortical layers.
Connectivity: Projects to the thalamus, completing the corticothalamic loop. It also sends axons to other cortical layers.
Neurons: A mix of pyramidal and multiform (nonspindle-shaped) cells.
Function: Regulates output to the thalamus and contributes to feedback modulation of sensory information.
- Multiform/Polymorphic
- Cells of multiple forms merge with white matter
- Pyramidal neurons, stellate neurons, bipolar/fusiform neurons
- Sends efferent fibers to the thalamus which establish a very precise reciprocal interconnection between the cortex and thalamus.
- Neurons from one cortical column connect with thalamus neurons that provide input to the same cortical column
- Forms recurrent connections
- Frequently connected to inhibitory neurons and rarely to excitatory neurons
-> Thalamus
<- Thalamus
    - Control gain, tonic/bursting thalamic neuron firing patterns, synchronisation of thalamus
    - Modulates its own from the thalamus

The neocortex, also known as the isocortex, is the part of the cerebral cortex involved in higher-order brain functions such as sensory perception, cognition, generation of motor commands, spatial reasoning, and language. It is characterized by a six-layered structure, with each layer having distinct connectivity patterns, cell types, and functions. The six layers, from the outermost surface inward, are:

The computations performed by the neocortex involve a wide range of processes such as feature detection, pattern recognition, predictive coding, and decision-making. These computations are thought to arise from the interactions between excitatory neurons (mainly pyramidal cells) and inhibitory interneurons (such as basket cells, chandelier cells, and Martinotti cells), which use glutamate and GABA as their primary neurotransmitters, respectively.

Each type of neuron has distinct morphological, biochemical, and electrophysiological properties, which contribute to the neocortex's overall function. Pyramidal cells are typically excitatory and have a characteristic triangular-shaped cell body with a single apical dendrite extending towards the cortical surface and multiple basal dendrites. In contrast, interneurons are diverse, generally inhibitory, and regulate the activity of pyramidal cells to maintain the balance of excitation and inhibition in the cortical networks.

The neocortex is involved in a variety of complex feedback and feedforward loops, both within itself and with other brain regions, allowing for sophisticated processing and integration of information across multiple modalities. Understanding the full complexity of the neocortex's connectivity and function is an ongoing area of research in neuroscience.

II, III:
    - Do most of the processing
I, IV:
    - Both receive input from thalamus
    - They both transmit information to II,III
I, II, III:
    <- Interhemispheric corticocortical
    - Priniciple targets of interhemispheric corticocortical afferent fibers
    - It appears that these layers exist for high-level conscious control (attention, etc.) and layers including and below IV exist for computation and extraction of information
- Currently, AI models really only implement layers 2-5. Layers 1 and 6 seem to give cognitive function.

# Cortical column
[Cortical column]
In simulations, a mini-column has 16 cells. A cortical column has 150-250 mini-columns. Results in 2400 to 4000 cells per column.

# Areas
## Ventromedial prefrontal cortex
The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is implicated in the processing of risk and fear as it is critical in the regulation of amygdala activity in humans. It also plays a role in the inhibition of emotional responses and in the process of decision-making and self-control. And in the cognitive evaluation of morality.

Receives input from the ventral tegmental area, amygdala, temporal lobe, olfactory system, and the dorsomedial thalamus.

Sends signals to the temporal lobe, amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, hippocampal formation, cingulate cortex, and other regions of the prefrontal cortex.
