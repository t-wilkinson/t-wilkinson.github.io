# Theory of music
Painting a story. Establish a topos, a context of truth and meaning. Establish truth, structures, etc. Introduction of most important truths (climax).

Notes and collections of notes.

Texture, soundscape, tonal center, intervals

Textures made of sound with varying variations

Sounds that interact with each other in the moment and sounds that interact with the cognitive position in the music.

# Musicality
On notes repeated on the beat (with accompanying notes offbeat), apply a dynamic, making those more pronounced or quieter. Or really to any voice.
Bring out voices that contrast nicely or support nicely the main melody

## Springs
Alternating notes that converge or diverge create movement to a resolution or tension point. Apply (de)crescendos to help move the music forward and assist in achieving the goal.
## Chromatics
Suggest dynamic change
## Tenuto
Can suggest an immediate slow down then progressive speed up as long as the chord is held down. Has harmonic implications as the chord is held.
## Principle emphasis
There is a constant dance between what is the main voice heard, to seperate melodic lines.
## Melody
Melodic lines or higher register notes can summarize notes.
## Grace notes
Creates movement to a harmonic note
## Chord shaping
Higher notes have more emphasis naturally so music take care to deemphasise higher notes.
## Dissapation
Higher notes dissapate faster so those with melodic, harmonic, or principle voice significance should be played louder.
## Ladder
A repeated pattern that is shifting in registers can be played with sequences of crescendos or decrescendos.
## Alternating notes
Alternating notes (perhaps with slight chromatic variations) can be played in alternating crescendos and decrecendos with an underlying (de)crescendo.
## Direction based movement
Treat it as several entering/dissapearing melodic lines.

# Conceptual tools
- Circle of fifths
    ? Why do they differ by one accidental
        - Notes differ by perfect 5ths
        - At the 6 degree, switches a WH -> HW
    - Nearby notes have very similar relationships to notes around the circle
        - Similar key signatures
        - Dissonant/consonnant will sound similarly to the other root
    - Moving around relatively increases brightness
    - Significance of the fifths
        - Find the first note that has a sharp 11 notes in, let that be X
        - Now move 7 notes from X (clockwise along the circle of fiths), let that be Y
        - Continue the major scale from Y
        - The 4th note from Y will be the sharp 11 notes from X, $4 + 7 == 11$
    - Interpret the above in terms of degrees
    - Moving up resovles with plagal cadence or equivalently plays the dominant function. The result depends on what is played next. The context.
    - Because their fifths, stacking scales from progressing through fifths overlaps 4 degrees
    - Major scale is formed by moving along the circle of fifths and transposing notes to be in order
    - In 12 tone equal temperment, fifths is the only way to form a scale other than the chromatic scale though jumps as 5 and 7 doesn't divide into 12

- Chromatic circle
- Orbifold

# Acoustics
- Overtone series
- Undertone series

- Why doesn't inverting a chord change its harmony? Because of the overtone series.
- The human brain can only hold so many notes before it becomes too chaotic.

The major scale is a sequence of fifths, not including the tritone of the root.

Overtone series (Harmonic series)
The overtone series has

Undertone series

# Analysis
# Elements
- Melody (pitch, dynamics, intervals)
- Harmony (texture, polyphonic, monophonic)
- Rythm (form, beat, tempo, meter, duration)
- Timbre

## Interval

- Notes have the most harmonic similarity with their octaves. However the distance can manipulate the feeling of space, closeness, etc. Relationships between notes are minimized as the octave increases.
- Distance between two notes
- Qualities
    - Perfect := $4 5 8$
    - Major := $2, 3, 6, 7$
    - Minor := $♭2, ♭3, ♭6, ♭7$
    - Augmented := $♯4 ♯5$
    - Diminished := $♭♭3 ♭4 ♭5$
    - Tritone := 6 semitones | aug4 | dim5
        - The V7 chord has a tritone between 3 and 7
        - vii∅7 has two tritones
    - Augmented and Diminished are accidentals on the perfect intervals
    - Intevals are defined in relation to major scale
    - Major intervals made
        - 1 semitone smaller are minor
        - 2 semitone smaller are diminished
        - 1 semitone larger are augmented
    - Perfect intervals made
        - 1 semitone smaller are diminished
        - 1 semitone larger are augmented
    - For odd intervals find the interval without accidentals then see how the accidentals modify the interval
- Inverting
    - To invert an interval change the sign and add to nine
    - Maj <-> Min
    - Aug <-> Dim
    - Perfect <-> Perfect
    - Tritone <-> Tritone
- Intervals around the circle of fifths
    0. p0
    1. p5
    2. maj2
    3. maj6
    4. maj3
    5. maj7
    6. aug4/dim5/tritone
    7. min2
    8. min6
    9. min3
    10. min7
    11. p4
    12. p8
- Chords are formed by combining intervals

## Chord
- Hybrid chord
    - Extended chords with a dropped 3
- Chord-scale relationships
    CM7			    C major scale or C Lydian scale
    CM7♯11			C Lydian scale
    CM♯5			C Lydian-Augmented scale
    Cm7			    C dorian scale or C natural minor

- Triads sound strongest in second inversion
- The 3 is important in triads because the minor/major 3 is the next harmonic after the 5
- There are no wrong notes in a chord. Just haven't found its purpose.
- Usually built from thirds because it is harmonically pleasing
- Types
    Major. $1 3 5$
    Major7. $1 3 5 7$ (always written Cmaj⁷)
    Minor. $1 ♭3 5$
    Minor7. $1 ♭3 5 ♭7$
    Diminished. $1 ♭3 ♭5$
    Diminished7. $1 ♭3 ♭5 ♭♭7$
        - Every note is same distance away
        - There are only 3 possible dim7 chords
        - Raising/lowering any of the notes will bring you to a different key
        - Every diminished can be turned into a major chord in a different key
        - Every major chord can be converted to a diminished chord in any key
    HalfDiminished7. $1 ♭3 ♭5 ♭7$
    Augmented. $1 3 ♯5$
        - Only 3 possible chords
    Augmented7. $1 3 ♯5 7$

        - Has a tritone
        - Dominant have mirror keys that they can resolve to
    Inversions. "chord" / "base"
- The $vii∅7$ acts very similarly to $V7♭9$ with no root

- Extensions
    - The 1 3 5 7 are chord tones and establish the type of chord
    - Chords can be extended with 9 11 13
    - 9 11 13 add flavor but don't establish chord quality and are not leading tones
- Shell chord
    - Shell chords represent the minimum harmonic material needed to play a chord
    - Simpler
    - Easier to harmoize over/improvise as there are more available notes
- Secondary chords
    - V7 or iidim7
- Suspended chords
    - sus2, sus4, 9sus4, ♭9sus4
    - Can substitute for ii or V7 chords
    - Phrygian chords are sus♭9 chords
        - isus♭9♭13
        - By changing ♭3 to a 4, converts to Isus♭9♭13
        - Dropping the ♭13 results in Isus♭9
- Slash chords
    - Specify a note to play in the bass
    - Define how the bass line moves
- Polychord
- Borrowed chord
    - Chord from a different key
    - Usually parallel major or minor

- Chords are built from specific notes, so the axis represents a relationship between each of the notes
    - Stable notes := 1 5
    - Modal notes := 3 ♭3
        - Bring the focus towards either the root or p5
    - Hollow notes := 6 ♭7
        - Tritone from modal notes
    - Unstable notes := 2 4
        - Half step from modal notes
        - Modal notes aren't strong enough resolutino
    - Leading notes := 7 ♭6
        - Leading notes
    - Uncanny notes := ♭2 ♯4
        - Half step from stable notes
        - Tritone from hollow notes

"Can you give me an exhaustive list of chord types, such as the standard major, minor, dominant chords. For each chord, show the chord symbol, include the intervals in the chord and the overall harmonic and emotional effect of the chord. Also include jazz chords and also common chords that you may find in prokofiev, scriabin, or sorabji's music."

Creating an exhaustive list of all chord types and their variants would be a monumental task, given the vast number of possible combinations and alterations. However, I can provide a list of some common chord types found in a variety of musical genres, including Western classical music, jazz, and the works of composers like Prokofiev, Scriabin, and Sorabji. For each chord type, I'll provide the chord symbol, the intervals (relative to the root of the chord), and a brief description of their harmonic and emotional effects.

Triads:
    Major (C): [Root, Major 3rd, Perfect 5th]
        Effect: Bright, stable, and consonant.
    Minor (Cm): [Root, Minor 3rd, Perfect 5th]
        Effect: Darker, melancholic, and still relatively stable.
    Augmented (C+): [Root, Major 3rd, Augmented 5th]
        Effect: Bright but tense and unstable, often used for modulation.
    Diminished (C°): [Root, Minor 3rd, Diminished 5th]
        Effect: Dark, tense, and unstable, often resolving to a major or minor chord.

Seventh Chords:
    Major 7th (CM7): [Root, Major 3rd, Perfect 5th, Major 7th]
        Effect: Smooth, jazzy, with a sense of completeness but also forward motion.
    Minor 7th (Cm7): [Root, Minor 3rd, Perfect 5th, Minor 7th]
        Effect: Softer than a dominant 7th, contemplative, and slightly melancholic.
    Dominant 7th (C7): [Root, Major 3rd, Perfect 5th, Minor 7th]
        Effect: Tense, bluesy, and demands resolution, often to a major or minor chord a fourth above.
    Half-Diminished 7th (Cø7): [Root, Minor 3rd, Diminished 5th, Minor 7th]
        Effect: Mysterious, unresolved, often used in jazz and classical modulations.
    Fully Diminished 7th (C°7): [Root, Minor 3rd, Diminished 5th, Diminished 7th]
        Effect: Very tense and unstable, it can resolve in multiple directions due to its symmetry.
    Minor/Major 7th (Cm(M7)): [Root, Minor 3rd, Perfect 5th, Major 7th]
        Effect: Bittersweet, with a combination of darkness and brightness, often found in jazz.

Extended Chords:
    Ninth (C9): [Root, Major 3rd, Perfect 5th, Minor 7th, Major 9th]
        Effect: Rich and colorful, with added tension from the ninth.
    Major 9th (CM9): [Root, Major 3rd, Perfect 5th, Major 7th, Major 9th]
        Effect: Lush and expansive, often used in jazz ballads.
    Minor 9th (Cm9): [Root, Minor 3rd, Perfect 5th, Minor 7th, Major 9th]
        Effect: Moody and complex, with a hint of mystery.
    Eleventh (C11): [Root, Major 3rd, Perfect 5th, Minor 7th, Major 9th, Perfect 11th]
        Effect: Very dense and colorful, often with the 3rd omitted in practice to avoid dissonance.
    Thirteenth (C13): [Root, Major 3rd, Perfect 5th, Minor 7th, Major 9th, Perfect 11th, Major 13th]
        Effect: Extremely rich and complex, encompassing nearly the entire tonal spectrum.

Altered Chords:
    Altered Dominant (C7♯5♭9): [Root, Major 3rd, Augmented 5th, Minor 7th, Minor 9th]
        Effect: Tense and dissonant, often used to create a strong sense of tension before resolving to the I chord in a jazz or classical context.
    Minor 7th ♭5 (Cm7♭5): [Root, Minor 3rd, Diminished 5th, Minor 7th]
        Effect: Somber and unresolved, commonly found in jazz and also known as the half-diminished seventh chord.

Suspended Chords:
    Suspended 2nd (Csus2): [Root, Major 2nd, Perfect 5th]
        Effect: Open and airy, with a sense of suspension or anticipation.
    Suspended 4th (Csus4): [Root, Perfect 4th, Perfect 5th]
        Effect: Similarly open and unresolved, often used to delay the resolution to a major or minor chord.

Added Tone Chords:
    Add9 (Cadd9): [Root, Major 3rd, Perfect 5th, Major 9th]
        Effect: Bright and open, with the ninth adding a melodic extension to the harmony.

Polytonal and Polychordal Constructions:
    Polytonal Chord (C/G♭): [C Major chord + G♭ Major chord]
        Effect: Complex and dissonant, creating a sense of two tonalities clashing.
    Polychord (C/E♭m): [C Major chord over E♭ Minor chord]
        Effect: The combination of two different chords can create unusual and rich sonorities.

Clusters and Non-Tertian Chords:
    Tone Cluster (C[C-D-E♭]): [Multiple adjacent notes played together]
        Effect: Highly dissonant and texturally dense, often used for dramatic effect.
    Quartal Chord (C Quartal): [Built in fourths, e.g., C-F-B♭-E♭]
        Effect: Open and modern sounding, often used in jazz and 20th-century classical music.

Chords from Composers like Prokofiev, Scriabin, and Sorabji:
    Scriabin's Mystic Chord: [Root, Augmented 4th, Augmented 4th, Major 3rd, Major 3rd]
        Effect: Otherworldly and enigmatic, central to Scriabin's late harmonic language.
    Prokofiev's "Suggestion Diabolique" Chords: Specific dissonant chords used for dramatic and unsettling effects in his works.
        Effect: Striking, with a sense of unease or instability.
    Sorabji's Dense Polyphony and Micro-polyphony: Creates chords through the layering of many independent lines.
        Effect: Immersive and complex, contributing to a massive and sometimes overwhelming sound world.

## Scales
- A collection of notes
- An interesting harmonic structure. A certain harmonic pattern.
- Degrees
    1. Tonic
    2. Supertonic
    3. Mediant
    4. Subdominant
    5. Dominant
    6. Submediant
    7. Leading tone (half step from tonic so it "leads" to the tonic)
- Symmetrical scales
    - Create atonal structure because notes are not distinguished from each other
    - Examples
        - Chromatic
        - Wholetone
        - H/W diminished (1 2 1 2)
        - W/H diminished (2 1 2 1)
        - Augmented (3 1 3 1)
        - Tritone scale (1 3 2 1 3 2)
        - Two-semitone tritone scale (1 1 4 1 1 4)

## Modes
- Just another scale
- Different root tone of a scale
- All possible diatonic scales
- All possible rotations of scale
- Every mode except locrian (♭5) is a rotation of the circle of fifths
- The distance between notes, particilarly in relation to the root is what sets the mood of modes
- The leading tone is important to create suspense between 7 and 1 but in Dorian etc, it is a whole step, so V chords don't have such a pull to the root
- Modes of constant key
    - Take all notes with note in key signature
    - Find the mode with key at root
    - Mode extensions
        - Mega lydian := Lydian has the same notes as p5 scale
        - Mega ? := ? has the same notes as p4 scale
        - Super-Ultra-Hyper-Mega-Meta Lydian := Stacking lydians by progressing through the circle of fifths
            - Wraps itself around the brightest side of the scale
        - Super-locrian wraps itself around the darkest part of scales
        - Gives insights to how to color chords
        - Infinite wraps around the circle of fifths, considering the first four note modifications of each mode, and the last four as further extensions
        - Moving modes across the circle of fifths creates a more major/minor feel
        - Right is the dominant
        - Left is the subdominant
        - Modes without extensions create a flatter (relatively) scale. Like repeating a section of a mode extension.
- In terms of brightness
    4. Lydian
    1. Ionian
    5. Mixolydian
    2. Dorian
    6. Aeolian
    3. Phrygian
    7. Locrian
- Any scale that preserves the 5ths (not locrian) is a rotation of the circle of fifths. Non diatonic scales do not preserve the scale alterations
- Can you take any scale, move around circle of fifths and differ by only one note?

## Key
- A context. Establishes a tone which determines how consonant other tones are.
- Tonal + Scale
- Parallel key (CMaj, CMin) := Same root
- Relative key (CMaj, aMin) := Same notes
- The context of a musical piece
- Due to equal temperment (12 tone) tuning, the specific key does not matter. What does matter is the mode one is using of a certain key. Keys matter when not using 12 tone tuning like in olden days when music would be written for certain instruments.
- Use of a scale in a musical composition
- How a collection of notes (scale) relate or should be interpreted
- Scale around which music revolves
- The specific name given to a scale

- Key signatures
    - C♭ : B♭ E♭ A♭ D♭ G♭ C♭ F♭
        - B is two fifths away from A which results in the step down
    - C♯ : F♯ C♯ G♯ D♯ A♯ E♯ B♯
        - F is two sevenths away from G which results in the step up

## Tempo
- Rhythm
- Triplets
- Meter
- Time signature
- Polymeter
- Polyrhythm
    - [5:7 counting in 3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32LcntJXywM)

## Tonality
- The harmonics describe keys that establish/break tonality. Earlier harmonics are more important for establishing tonality. 1 p5 M3 m7... The harmonics describe intervals that exhibit more consonance. The tonal center is the note that is most consonant with other intervals.
- Overtone series orders intervals by consonance
- Center piece of the scale that feels completely resolved and at rest
- Esablish a tonic by giving the note a central distinguish
    - Position/passage
        - Beggining/ending at tonic
    - Repeating the tonic
    - Dynamic emphasis
        - playing with more power
    - Range emphasis
        - Play tonic as highest/lowest note
    - Rhythmic emphasis
    - Bassline
- Displacement from tonic introduces tension and moving back toward it resolves the tension
- Brightness
    - Opening vs closing
    - Different modes have different brightness
    - Relative to other scales
    - Intervals in scales are a large driver of brightness
        - Ionian has a major
    - Larger steps tend to be brighter
- V7 and vii∅7 are important for establishing tonality
    - Create dissonance
    - Dominant contains tritone
    - Diminshed contains two tritones
    - Contain the 7
    - Lead towards 1 and 5
    - The root or 1 3 5 chord resolves the tension and establishes a home

## Function
- The relationship of chord or scale degree to tonal center
- Theories
    - German theory by Hugo Riemann
        - Tonic
        - Subdominant
        - Dominant
    - Viennese theory
        - Roman numerals denote the chords of the tonal scale
- Harmony
    ? How does chords in each diatonic function differ to I
    - I vi iii function as the tonic
        - vi7 and iii7 only differ one note from the tonic
        - All share the 3rd degree of the scale, centers the surrounding notes
        - The 3 is very important in establishing a tonal center
    - ii IV function as the subdominant
        - Create instability but not in any particular direction
        - Function differs depending on traid vs. 7 chord
        - The 4 being a half step from 3 results in small direction towards root
    - V7 vii∅7 function as the dominant
        - Point back to tonic
        - Both have the 2 and 7 of the scale, which encircle 1
        - The 7 is only a half step from 1
        - They also have 4 which is a half step from 3
- Cadence := How music is resolved
    - Authentic := V I
    - Plagal := IV I
    - Deceptive := V vi

# Harmony
- Available tensions
- Harmonization
- Reharmonization
- Progressions
- Chord voicing
- Passing chords
- Harmony as color theory
    - Musical harmony is like mixing colors. You start with basic primary colors, each has a clear, distinct, but simple effect. Adding notes adds colors. Adding too many colors becomes chaotic and can become muddy.

# Realization
- [Duality]
- [Structure (systems science)]
- Melody and harmony

- Think primarily the experience that sound provides
- Focus on the sounds (theory is just a language for describing the sounds)
- Ultimately music is something that is experienced. So all structure exists from the context of the listener. Theory exists to formalize these structures and isolate them.
- Bring out notes that harmony revolves around. Eg bring out the descending baseline, etc.

- The p4 of the major scale causes dissonance with m3, lydian, altough it it has a tritone, is generally more consonant than major chord. Intervals are named because of distance from root note, not position in any scale.
- Music is all about the experience, focus on the experience, don't prematurely label anything (major chords are not happy and minor chords are not sad). It is ultimately contextual.
- Minimize tension in your playing but not your music
- Music is about adding dissonance and consannce to introduce tension and release it. This is the story of life. Without it life becomes more empty.
- Middle C is a pivot point
    - Playing closed harmony that is not balanced around middle C will feel unbalanced
- Avoid notes sound bad, chord tones sound good, tensions sound jazzy

- Duality
    - P5 and P4 is like major and minor
    - Chords consist of the unity, duality, and union
        - Unity := Center of chord
        - Union := M3 away from unity
        - Duality := P5 away from unity
    - A minor chord is a perfect 4th down
    - Constructing a chord with 5ths, the first 3rd is major
    - Constructing a chord with 4ths, the first 3rd is minor

- Formalization
    - Embelishment are sheafs on manifold of the musical piece, each a different interpretation that evokes a different emotion.
    - Chord voicing is a topos of sheafs on manifold of chords, each sheaf is a realization of chords

- Structure
    - Harmony is the creation and divergence from structure
    - Convergence to structure releases tension, brings you home. Diverging creates interest and tension.
    - Diverging creates tension and interest
    - Examples
        - Melodic phrase
        - Scale
        - Chord progression
        - Functionality (structure)
            - Musical structure has a goal, ie: diatonic chords
        - Non-functional
            - Still just as harmonic as functional, just different structure, a different home to resolve to
            - Non-functional harmony removes the long-term purpose or context of harmony. Each harmony is experienced only when it's played, and it's all that is experienced, until the piece continues. It evokes a timeless and aimless experience. Nihlism. You have no home so you are always lost or always home, a matter of perspective. The musician can help the listener choose by making each moment more or less enjoyable.
            - Atonal
            - Parallel chord motion
            - Chromaticism
            - Modes
            - Exotic scales
            - Voice-leading
        - Keys
            - Relative key has the sames notes but different root (C maj / G mixolydian)
            - Parallel key has same root but different notes (maj/min)
    - Art is made through the creation and resolution of tension
    - Divergence
        - Tension notes := notes on edge of structure
        - Playing melody before/after expected chord progression
        - Cycled patterns := moving a piece of structure around
        - Symmetric scales
        - Dissonant intervals
        - Avoid notes
            - Inherently dissonant, exits harmonic structure of chord
            - Note that is one semitone about a chord tone
            - C13 and CMaj13 omit 11 because it is an avoid note
            - Avoid notes cause dissonant interval with one of the chord tones. They change the quality of the chord.
            - Dominant has a tritone and so is inherently dissonant
            - ♭9 ♯9 for Maj7 and min7
            - ♮11
            - ♭13 for min7
        - Atonality
            - Symmetric scales
    - Convergence
        - Guide tones
            - 3 and 7 are guide tones and establish the chord quality. The 1 and 5 establish the key. 3 and 7 should be focused on when improvising the melody, they are the most consonant?.
            - Progressions preserving the 3 or 7 are more smooth
        - Playing inside

# Timbre
# Rhythm
n:m := n beats subdivided by m, sound played by subdivision marked by number, _ represents no sounds played for that beat, p/ means the immediately following group is subdivided into p instead of m
subdivide n beats by m, offset the sound by m+x or m-x (usually x=1) until it resolves

# Scales
Super Ultra Hyper Mega Meta Scales
Metalydian is a symmetric pattern that does not repeat each octave (WWWH)

Mix up scales:
- Mixolydian Lydian
- M3 m6 M7
- m3 M6 M7
- Phrygian M3

## Messiaen modes
1. Whole tone, 2 transpositions, 1 mode
2. Diminished, 3 transpositions, 2 modes
3. WHHWHHWHH (1 2 ♭3 3 ♯4 5 6 ♭7), 3 transpositions, 2 modes
4. H-H-3H-H-H-H-3H-H, 6 transpositions, 4 modes
5. H-4H-H-H-4H-H, 6 transpositions, 3 modes
6. W-W-H-H-W-W-H-H, 6 transpositions, 4 modes
7. H-H-H-W-H-H-H-H-W-H, 6 transpositions, 5 modes

Truncation:
Removing notes from a mode to leave a truncated mode. The removed notes and remaining notes must preserve the symmetry of the parent mode.
Mode 7 and 3 are not truncated modes, the other modes can be constructed from them or from one or more of their modes. Mode 7 contains 1 2 3 4 5 6, mode 6 contains 1 5, mode 4 contains 5, mode 3 contains 1.

## 5 note scales
5 note scales are generally more thought of melodically, connecting various harmonic contexts. A collection of intervals that tie together various harmonies starting and ending harmonically arbitrarily, instead appealing to need. One is not so concerned with forming chords from these small scales, instead one should explore chords and their variations in their own right.
