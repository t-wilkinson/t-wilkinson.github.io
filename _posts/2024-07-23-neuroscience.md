How do inhibitory neurons strengthen connections? Synaptic plasticity.

? How do high IQ individuals brains differ

Each neural network in the brain establishes a equivalence class between neural representations and the output of that area.

Neuroscience is the study of the nervous system and its functions. Sub-fields of neuroscience deal with understanding the nervous system under different contexts such as diesease, toxicity, cognition, etc.

Neuroscience is data rich, theory poor. There is a large base of constraints for a theory, but no theory which satisfies those constraints.

Hebbian theory (neurons that fire together wire together)

- Nervous System
- Default mode network: capacity for self awareness
    - People who are depressed have higher level of default mode network
    - Meta level self-observation to improve overall chances of sucess
    - Ketamine shuts off the default mode network
    - Psychedelics fracture your sense of self so there is nothing to reflect on

Emotions provide efficient contextual sparse networks. Default nmode neetwork wnables self reflection, a power tool for entities acting within an environment. The brain functions on sparse networks. They increase the parameters while reducing computation requirments (the brain uses a lot of energy and resources, another example of how the brain is evolutionary driven). Emotions are an example of sparse networks/modules. They efficiently encode responses to different internal and external environments (relative to the experience of the being).

There are interesting similarities between some corical circuits and wave function collapse in quantum mechanics. In particular, the thalamus and neocortex have combinations of stellate and pyramidal neurons. Pyramidal neurons look to identify combinations or contexts of patterns and then inhibit surrounding neurons through stellate neurons. The states that each pyramidal neuron represents attempts to model a collection of states that some specific circuitry is receiving. If this is true, then some quantum mechanics equations could be used to model the brain and quantum computers useful at representing more complex cortical circuits such as cortical columns.

Just like how the occipital lobe focuses on visual input. The frontal cortex focuses on executive function. An artificial brain should have some architectural design promoting the ability to create goals and use those goals to change the context of information being processed.

To work like the human brain, although the hidden state encodes working memory, there needs to be a way to actually train the model based on working memory in between tasks (sleep).

The path to AGI will take understanding what functional units do of each part of the brain, and finding the best computational implementation for those.

To encode focus, one might direct the output of the focus module directly to attention modules.

Transformers treat each word equally, which has high computational costs for larger sequences. What about somehow only careing about some encoded representation of whole sentences, and paying attention to a couple of words.

Look more at recent papers of attention models.

# Questions
- How does the brain decide what to build models of the world? Especially given it already has some.
- There is this contextual executive functioning which is controlling attention. Conciousness is some awareness of sensory input. The constant reciprical path of information being controlled by attention and that information having an effect on attention must be conciousness. The neocortex is a computer that is constantly updating itself, optimizing itself in order to then control how the body interacts with the world. Are people without thalamuses concious? What injueries tyo the brain creates a decreasee in what we consider consciousness? Awareness comes from this reciprical passing of information. People aren't directly aware of the models their brain is building, but instead the effects of those models on information passing through.
- Grid cells in the entrohinal cortex form a hexagonal coordinate system. Why this instead of cublical like 2d euclidean plane? Well we usually need to represent 3 dimensions.
- Context is important as it provides some commonality and context in which to derive meaning to compare objects. Where is the meaning of this context encoded in the brain? Each is formed from different input information. This information is used to perform computations on information that eventually lead to actions in the world.
- The prefrontal cortex stores highly abstract information which has a long term effect on the organism. In order to see these effects a lot of emprical data must be collected.
- I believe hexagons are used because hexagons are the most efficient way to tile a plane. Therefore fewer neurons need to be used! Coordinate systems themselves don't matter much. Because, as you learn in differential geometry there is a differnetial map between any two coordinate systems.
- Graphs are a natural data structure for how the brain represents information. But what about topoi?
- Path integration is accumulating various paths to determine where the final location is.
- Latent space is important here.
- The more an animal interacts in a space, the more data it has and more accurate it can build maps of the space it was interacting in. This knowledge does not necessarily transfer to hidden areas.
- The thalamic-cortical circuits has a way of quickly changing the context of the brain through firing and bursting mode. Is self-attention similar?

# Cognitive neuroscience
Attention occurs at the various hierarchies of cognitive organization. Neurotransmitters can quickly create or temporary or prolonged attention through further sparse activations of neural networks.

The brain continuously learns, potentially through sparse activation networks which each learn. The brain doesn't learn from backpropogation.

Sparse networks enable faster inferencing and much lower energy expenditure. By contextualizing inputs, networks specialized for each context only operate. Greatly increases representational capacity without increasing computational costs.

Almost always, there are only 2% active cells at anytime. Sparse population codes. Generally, sparser activations implies a more confident understanding of the model being formed. Brain is very robust. Sparse representation is robust. Doesnt have issues woth GAN. 95% of synapses are predictive. Inhibit other neurons. Detect patterns. Neurons in deep learning only capture a portion of functionality of neurons in the brain.

# Research
One common property to overcome when studying neurons is measuring information on functioning neurons. There is a tradeoff between high data collection but incomplete environment, or low data collection but complete environment. The development of transgenic methods can

# Trivia
- Human memory ranges from 1 to 1,0000 terabytes (possibly depending on recall and overall compression of knowledge, and efficiency of storage)
- Synaptic cleft is 20 nanometers
- Hydrogen atom is ~0.1 to 10 nano meters
- Typical neuron fires 5-20 times every second. This is likely the equilibrium point where if neuron fires outside of that range, it is removed/made less active
- Human hair is 17μm to 181μm
- 100 billion neurons (and many more neuroglia which serve and protect the neurons)
- Neurons can be connected to up to 10,000 other neurons
- Up to 1,000 trillion synapses
- Therefore, on average, each neuron is connect to t10 synapses
- 2% of neurons are active at any point in time

# Neuroplasticity
- [How to Focus to Change Your Brain | Huberman Lab Podcast #6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as)
    - Neuroplasticity requires focus on the area of interest
    - Brains 0-25 are very neuroplastic
- Must be alert
- Short vs. Medium vs. Long term
- Focus and arousal triggers neuroplasticity
- Neuroplasticity occurs during deep rest
- Focus
    - Duration Path Outcome
    ? What is focus
- Focus on the neural structure in charge of what your trying to change, then envision how it should change to accomodate goals you are trying to accomplish it. Then in life try to apply it. Repeat so you don't forget.
- Top-down vs. Bottom-up (Deliberate vs. Reflexive)
    - Impulsivity is lack of top-down control
- Brain can change itself
    - Neurons that aren't used for semantic processes (no nose to smell, lack of sight, etc), are re-purposed for other senses.
- Make deliberate actions reflexive
- Steps
    - Focus on behaviour to change releases epinephrine to the area of focus
    - Acetylcholine is released and binds to active neurons
    - During sleep and deep rest (not Duration Path Outcome) neurons binded to acetylcholine are modified (strengthed axons)

- Properties of neurons
    - axons and dendrites:
        - Stellate and pyramidal cells receive 1000s of synaptic inputs
        - Purkinje cells in the cerebellum receive 100,000s of synaptic inputs
    - ion chanels:
        - Na⁺ K⁺ Ca²⁺ Cl⁻
    - membrane potential:
        - The electrical signal of relevance to neurocircuitry the difference of electrical potential between the interior of a neuron and extracullular medium.
        - Neurons resting membrane potential is -70mV
        - Na⁺ is more concentrated outside a neuron
        - K⁺ is more concentrated inside a neuron
    - polarization:
        - hyperpolarization:
            - When neuron membrane potential becomes more negative.
        - depolarization:
            - When neuron membrane potential becomes more positive.
    - action potential:
        - Axons terminate at synapses where the voltage transient of the action potential opens ion channels, producing and influx of Ca²⁺ that leads to the release of a neurotransmitter.
        - When membrane potential reaches a certain value above -70mV, the neuron "fires". Voltage gated ion channels open allowing the membrane potential to normalize with the extracellular space.
    - refractory period:
        - For a few milliseconds after action potential, call an absolute refractory period, it may be virtually impossible for a neuron to fire. After this period, there is a relative refractory period lasting 10s of milliseconds which inhibits the neuron from firing.
- Recording neuronal responses
    - sharp and patch elecrodes
    - extracellular electrodes
- From stimulus to response
    - Neuronal responses reflect the complex intrinsic dynamics of the neuron and the temperal charactersitics of the stimulus.
    - Predicting neuronal stimulus response is potentially non-deterministic due to large variability in conditions and the apparent randomness of biophysics processes. As such, a statistical model is developed. Additionally, many neurons respond to the same stimulus, each responding differently to extract different features. As such, a population of neurons must be considered, and a resulting statistical model developed.
