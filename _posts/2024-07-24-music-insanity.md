Don’t try so hard to generalize and learn every conceivable technique. Instead, learn difficult technical pieces like Liszt and Chopin etudes, and master them completely. afterward develop general techniques for other roots, chords, and scales. other than learning pieces, focus on memorizing scales and chords.

A big part of chord technique is memorizing and developing natural capacity to open the hand to correct orientation. select chords that have troubled you, and break them down in every way (jumping from every combination of interval to every combination of intervals in every sequence on every combination of left and right hand, master all dynamics, etc). master the technique before really trying to learn every chord, it will greatly speed the process and make it more reliable.

practice should consist of in-depth chord/scale practice considering all inversions and omissions etc, technique practice where you aim for speed and precision, and memorization of as many scales and chords

finger independence pactice is also about playing chords and intervals and internalizing the different finger movements

use liszt etudes to cover every technique, afterward generalize to various chorss and scales. just focus on memorizing chords and scales.

the “if you can play it slow you can play it fast” mantra is relevant primarily when learning pieces that are well within technical capabilities. Developing technical capabilities however should be considered like working out and stretching, you must push yourself to edge of failure. slow practice is like learning to aim a bow woth varying degrees of force, low force requires different mechanics than high force, but both need to be mastered to master piano.

app that selects a random scale. random sequence of degrees, random sequence of chord inversions, rhythms

optimal technique results in minimal movement of wrist and fingers. smoothest possible movement. minimize work fingers need to do. rhythm groupings become somewhat unnecessary when you master scales amd chords amd technique, they teach you to plwy a sequence in awkward and impractical chunks, you wouldnt normally get in certain positions and they lead to clunky playing

double note sxale play sequence in one scale then jump along sequence in other scale

Music harmony has issues. Scales and chords are not the right way to think about these. There are collections of notes that serve as a backbone or structures, there are sequences of backbones or structures, then there are notes played simultaneously mostly taken from a backbone. There are ways to realize or voice sequences and simultaneous notes. The structures have various harmonic relationships. Hierarchical layers of related structures. Structures don't necessarily have direct restriction relationships. Or think of it as the intersection of possible overlapping structures of each structure as the fundamental musical context. Don't look at identifying related structures reductively, but additively. At every level there are breaks from the structure.

I should aim for Liszt’s transcendental etudes or hamelins etudes (and learning more pieces in general). in addition to memorizing chords and scales, it is important to connect it through pieces and for learning techniques harder to generalize in excercises. Take learning pieces as a skill, just like sight reading, the ability to quickly take a piece you just sight read, abstract parts, understand the techniques, harmonies, and purpose of notes, know what dynamics and timing to use, and to formalize everything into memorizable chunks and quickly play it is a skill.  
   
register: very important to voicings. higher registers permit denser chords, lower registers permit spacier chords. think of the overtone series.

you can get away with dissonance with good voice leading 

chord function is more relevant than chord quality.

to learn: break it into simplest bits of information then combine it like the partial order of a powerset. isolate into generalizable chunks, and master the most generalizable. hence why i prioritize chords.

things to improvise: octaves (scale or chord progression like hung rhapsody ending, mazeppa), finger indp like feux follets or ondine descending notes. franz liszt is perhaps best influence for things I want to improvise.  
study jacob collier music

scales are fake news. you can start the harmony from chords and let scales flow from there, chords dont have to come from the scale. free yourself. move chords around without reference to scale. leave the chord however you feel like.

melodies, chords, intervals, or scales can be first class citizens. it depends on the harmony and sound you're going for. isolate the sound or harmony you're working in and build from there.

voice leading: think of moving subshape through a sequence (voice leading). different voices can follow different sequences generated from different shapes

polyrhythm for melody. offset one melody, repeat melody as you are finishing up the original.

think of modes and harmonies as specifying notes, mapping of chords to collection of the notes such that all chords give a piece of characteristic sound for the mode. i dont have time to learn all scales or chords so i should focus on the music i want to perform. the harmony also includes how one diverges from harmony like alterations, additional chords used.

Pools of notes specify the collection of notes, and therefore the intervals. A harmony specifies particular central notes (the root in particular) and other key intervals. Chords containing those key intervals in combination with the key notes give the characteristic harmonic sounds. One can leave the harmony for increased harmonic direction.

There are note pools or inventories (like scales) and there are formations on those pools, called shapes and sequences. Taking thirds builds classical chord shapes. The pools have meaning once a harmony is selected and how the resulting pool from a base note relates to the harmony.

The goal is to internalize a large sum of patterns, such that I just need to quickly map sheet music to my pattern space and memorize that mapping.

The music you make depends on your training, studies, things you learn, and patterns learned. Learn patterns that lead to the music you want to develop, which facilitates thinking about music, harmony, melody, and rhythm the way you want to. What kind of music do I realistically want to play? Jazz, classical, compose? I like the creative aspect of music and improvisational ability. I like complex harmonies and interesting rhythms. I should learn jazz, but incorporate harmonies and textures from classical so that I can apply them to various chords or rhythms. Also to be able to show off flashy pieces.  
I should prioritize scale and chord knowledge. play through all chords in a scale with various voicings (thirds, fourths, split left and right hand) then I can start separating techniques generated from different harmonies  
need separation of harmony, technique, and rhythm. learn to quickly switch between combinations of each domain (melody/harmony, technique and embellishments, rhythm, dynamics). 

I see myself picking interesting textures from classical pieces and incorporating them into jazz, learning them in various harmonic contexts and improvising melodies over them. How can I use advanced classical textures like double thirds to create unique jazzy music that is otherwise better than its simple counterpart. That is, how can I best harmonize with the virtuosity I have developed but not make it overwhelming or out of place?

To find my style, I must find scales that I particularly like and master those. I can’t master every scale.   
Scales: I like non-tonal scales, double harmonic major, scales with minor third jumps, mixture of major/minor scale. Rhythm  
Chords: tertian harmony, polytonality  
Texture: ravel-like textures  
Melody and themes: introduction of various themes, simplification of themes or combination of other themes

## Harmony

### Jazz harmony

X∆7: 3 7 9 \#11 13  
X-7: b3 b7 9 11 13  
X7: 3 b7 b9 9 \#9 \#11 b13 13  
X-7b5: b3 b7 b5  
X7\#5: 3 b7 \#5  
X-**∆**7: b3 7  
X9sus: 11 b7 9  
Xsusb9: 11 b7 b9  
X-b6: b3 b6

## Technique variation

Dotted rhythm and similar variations. But stay very in time (124 124 etc). Short bursts in every rhythm grouping (2s 3s 4s 5s 32s 54s etc)  
Improvise on chord progression using different technique. Change chord progression using same technique  
Closed eyes  
Play precisely and evenly each dynamic. Master this before you really try to connect to dynamics  
Transpose

## Pool

Every transposition, inversion, alteration, and note omission/subsets  
Intervals  
Extended pools (scales spanning more than an octave) are stacks of shapes that fit an octave

Focus more on all 4 note shapes with intervals of m2, M2, m3 (1, 2, 3 semitones)  
major 2-2-1-2-2-2-1, natural minor 2-1-2-2-1-2-2, harmonic minor 2-1-2-2-1-3-1, melodic minor asc 2-1-2-2-2-2-1, wholetone 2-2-2-2-2-2, octatonic 1-2-1-2-1-2-1-2, double harmonic major 1-3-1-2-1-3-1, neapolitan major 1-2-2-2-2-2-1, neapolitan minor 1-2-2-2-1-3-1, augmented 1-3 \*3, messiaen (2 \*6, 1-2 \*4, 1-1-2 \*3, 1-1-1-3 \*2, 1-1-4 \*2, 1-1-2-2 \*2, 1-1-1-1-2 \*2), overtone (lydian dominant) 2-2-2-1-2-1-2, altered 1-2-1-2-2-2-2, pentatonic (diatonic 2-2-3-2-3, pelog, hirajoshi, kumoi, japanese 1-4-2-3-2), 9th chord (dom 2-2-3-3-2, maj 2-2-3-4-1, min 2-1-4-3-2), phrygian b3 3 1-2-1-1-2-1-2-2

minor (natural, harmonic, melodic), pentatonic (diatonic, pelog, hirajoshi, kumoi, japanese 1 b2 4 5 b7), symmetric (chromatic, augmented, messiaen modes), super locrian, oriental, enigmatic, hungarian major, major locrian, lydian minor, bebop, blues, leading whole-tone, lydian \#5, lydian b7, aeolian b5, locrian b4, six-tone symmetrical, prometheus, prometheus neapolitan

Messiaen modes  
Major (Ionian, dorian, phrygian, lydian, dominant, aeolian/natural minor, locrian)  
Harmonic minor (locrian nat6, ionian \#5, dorian \#4, phrygian dom, lydian \#2, altered dim)  
Melodic minor (jazz minor, dorian b2, lydian aug, lydian dom, mixolydian b6, locrian nat2, altered)  
Bebop (major, dominant, melodic, harmonic minor)  
Blues (major, minor)  
Halfstep between a whole step in a scale (like major). It creates 8 notes in scale so it always repeats on beat. Building teriary chords alternates between root 6 chord and diminished chord which can resolve to the root

Multi-octave shapes

Various small shapes invert and move up scale, 

Chords built around one or more chord tones add surrounding chromatic notes or harmonic notes (b11\#1235 or 71235 for a 135), chord clusters like notes adjacent notes in wholetone or chromatic

Practice scales with every transposition of finger placement

Octatonic (HW): \[1\]dim \[1\]7b9\#11 \[1\]7\#9\#11 \[1\]-7b9\#11 \[1\]-\#9\#11 \[1\]-\#9nat11nat13. \[2\]alt,nat13, \[2\](1 4 b6  9\)  
Double harmonic major: 1+7 2+7 3-b7 4-M7 5-b5 6+\#5 7o\#5

## Shapes

Note that ultimately the brain learns how things are used. Learn chords in a way that they are used. Take some sequence of chord shapes, sequence of notes, rhythm, technique, and chunk various combinations.

Stack intervals 2 3 4 5 (6 7 alone are too far away to stack them to form complex chords, but can create spacey feels, additionally have similar harmonic function to 2 3). Can combine different stacks (4s with a 3 on top, 2s (clusters) and 3s, etc.) or drop notes (2 3). Use pools like altered to diverge from harmony. This subsumes the common chord voicings of: drop 2 and 3, upper structures, quartal and quintal, cluster, altered chords

2s/7s/9s: chromatic, octatonic, whole tone, augmented, diatonic, pentatonic  
3s/6s/13s: 7th (3571 5137 1357 1537), 9th (135796 135794), 11th (135794 154 15794), 13th (135796 57961 3796 7961 1536 1536 neapolitan:\#461b3), diminished (1 b5 bb7 b3)  
4s/5s/11s: dominant quartal chords (c f\# bb eb), quartal (⅚ notes separated by p4), so what (lh p4 rh p4 M3)  
Other: 1251, 5125, 1561, 7157, 7137, three 4s/5s in left hand and 3 4s/5s in right hand  
Voicings: use chords from octatonic, whole tone, or augmented scale; use chords a third apart; superimposed triads; polytonal chords moving the same distance; extended harmonies; cluster chords; drop 2 drop 3 voicings drop the n note from the top down an octave

Petrushka chord, chords from mode, inversion with octaves, interval and their inversion (151 353 131 161 etc.), chromatic voicings (ala sorabji) (c c\# d\# f gb)

## Progressions

## Practice variations

Quickly pluck or play and release note, pluck each note n times quickly, start from trouble passage and progressively add surrounding notes, break note and hand positions like chopin op10no1 hold note androtate wrist to play the next one or two notes or note before and after current note, slow practice pay attention to phrasing and equality of tempo and dynamics focus on musicality

## Rhythm

Incorporate rhythm and embellishment exercises to scales and chords  
Sequence of rhythm elements  
Polyrhythm: 2:3:4, 5:6:6, 7:11 5:7, play polyrhythm but accent every 2nd beat of one hand for example  
Sub divide polyrhythm into sub beats: 1234 2234 3234 4234 5234 within 7 beats

Play the following rhythms on different subbeats: 4/4: 12 13 14 24(offbeat), 3/4: 13(swing)   
12 1 12, 12 12 1, 12 2, 12 2 2, 12 2 12 2 2, 12 1 12 2, 1 2 12 12 2 12 (mephisto)  
L1ea R1 2a a 4a L1ea 3ea R1 2a a 4a; 1tl 2tl 3tl 4tl; 1a & 3a &  
Prokofiev: 1 12 12, 2 on 3 polyrhythm but leave out one note  
Polyrhythm but leave beats out  
Change subdivision but leave certain beats out

4/1 1 3 1  
3/134 24 134  
3/3 2 1  
4/1 2 3 4 \_ 1  
2/1 1 12 3/3  
4/13 124 1  
4/12 13 14 24 23  
3/13 (swing)  
3/3 13 3 13 3 4/13 13  
5/25 13 24  
4/4 *1***e**a ea 4ea

Use the following rhythms to improve speeds of altering two shapes. For each repeat also consider using different fingerings:  
12, 112, 1122, 11212212, 1221, 

## Dynamics

For each finger, combination of fingers, and wrist, memorize ppp pp p m f ff fff and be able to transition smoothly from one dynamic to another in n repetitions. Treat dynamics like rhythm subdivisions and polyrhythms.

## Intervals

Double note scales of all intervals, play sequences of intervals changing in root notes. Play an interval moving it through a shape by sequence of intervals (12 45 67 23 or 12 34 56 71 or 13 45 27 56\)

## Exercises

Mix arpeggios, chords, scales, jumps, tremelos, finger independence, trills, etc. one per hand, different shape/sequence/rhythm per hand, same shape different inversion. 

Scale in contrary motion. on sone rhythm, play a note chromatically or within scale n degrees left or right (contrary or parallel)

Fast arpeggio one hand with fast large jumps in the other hand  
Play concurrent shapes through a sequence, play sequences through shape.

### Concurrent

Of any scale

pick chord moving outer notes through scale to next inversion (also try it with moving inner voicings up scale), split chord and expand both directions of scale (chromatic), large jump between shapes each shape moving through scale can do patterns like (shape jump shape shape return, etc.), pick a shape and move a certain voice through a sequence, arpeggiate chord while voicing the top note, stack chords with left and right hands, 

### Sequential

Move through a shape in many variations  
Move through a shape following a sequence (every nth degree, skip x degree back y degrees, connect 3 degrees skip back 2, connect 4 degrees skip forward 2, etc.), take a sequence in thirds to sixths and vice versa (a la liszt).  
Every possible fingering including static fingering (same fingering for every note), offsetting fingering especially for awkward fingerings

extended 153 315 531 15135 5135 5153 113 115 116 554 163 162  
   
Shape, double notes of every interval (including octaves) (from the root: 1232171 21324354), include melodic octaves surrounding interval in double note scales (consider playing octaves in some complex rhythmic fashion), arpeggio, every combination of fingers (12 23 34 45 123 345 134 235 1234\) (start at same degree but shift fingering every time) (cycle through fingerings), pick a degree and jump back and forth moving up the shape, fingers (like 1215 125 2152\) through shape, through shape every nth degree, up scale x notes start again y notes from last start (repeat back down), scale alternating hands (both one hand per octave and dividing scale into n notes or x/y notes per hand), move a note from one shape to another through a sequential shape, move trill up shape while holding chord, one hand diverging/converging voices from shape  
152 lh 613 rh going up some sequence of notes playing chords built from root shape

### Layering

Both hands arpeggio out final jump to a chord then return hands together in chord (or repeat another arppegio \+ chord, return to a different inversion or transposition), playing chords and connecting chords with octaves following a scale established by chord (either upcoming chord or previous chord), for each item in sequence of one shape go through sequence of another shape (121 1232 111243 3212 1413121324, etc.), arpeggio chords 5-1-35 / 13-5 / 35-1 / 2-12 / 5-13 / 51-3-6 / 5-13-6, 13 1 13 1 (up and back down an octave), 1-3-46-3-1 / 1-3-56-2-1, cycle concurrent shapes while moving through sequence, lh jumps from pedal tone to shape (1 12 1 23 1 34\) targeting every other rh note and rh plays scale/arpeggio/complex arpeggio

Practice scales all intervals and moving through scales at arbitrary sequences. intervals are the foundation of melody and harmony  
Arpeggio: Practice left hand moving back and forth over right hand that comes up a lot, both small and large intervals and arpeggios  
play 18 5 3, then again n notes up shape 18 5 b3, then again m notes down shape 18 5 3  
Prokofiev practice: mix these groupings around. 138 1875 37531 7315 33 77531 753 7531 753 7531\. Also swap directions. Now move sequence through a shape  
Combine arpeggio one hand prokofiev practice In the other at polyrhythm

Pick two notes play octaves and jump through sequence back to center (every time or every other) in opposite directions can play chords or some shape of notes when jumping out (like the note of sequence plus its 2b3 on right hand and 7\#6 and left hand)

Take n fingers and move them through (chord) shape both within octave and large jumps (practices quickly switching chords and inverting chords)

jump from note or notes to note or notes larger than an octave away through a sequence. combine left and right hand and some interesting rhythms. try scarbo or mazeppa like interval ghost note (maybe with octave) or la clochette arpeggio before jumping back 

arpeggios (potentially longer than an octave) but changing one voice (or multiple voices). Also do with some chord shape

Polyrhythm scales and arpeggios

exercises for organ

**Mastery**  
Sight reading, chords and scales, and exercises on those chords and scales  
For any exercise: aim for two hands going in parallel and contrary motion with different harmony and rhythm; quickly switch between harmonies, patterns, and directions  
Sight reading  
Finger independence: there is 5 choose k with k ranging from 1 to 5, or 31, different combinations of fingers in a hand. 961 different binary alterations and 29791 triary alterations. There is 961 different combinations of left and right hand finger patterns. It is somewhat unrealistic to master all 961 and 29791 patterns, so approximate them with a good subset choice. Master a couple individual patterns but also try a speed run.  
Scales: with every possible fingering, all intervals, movement between intervals, different scale and interval each hand, ondine descending scale pattern, scale with subdivisions  
Chords: memorize every 3 note chord and most 4 note chords, absolute, from scales, chromatic, voicings, broken chords, chromatic movements like prokofievs chords  
Arpeggios: runs, arpeggio with subdivision  
Octaves  
Large jumps from one finger to another (sequence from scale or chord, jump intervals, jump to 2 through 6 chords)

**Pedal**  
Similar to dynamics, master various fractional pedals.

**Intervals**  
All intervals with lowest note doubled. Jump octaves or other intervals through intervals  
thumb and another finger in sequence up octave playing different intervals with each hand and offsetting when thumb of each hand plays  
quickly move fixed interval and fingering through sequence for each finger (like chromatic thumb harmonic major index) or use same sequence, make sequence more complex, incorporate jumps given by sequence  
alternate converging or diverging notes with one hand of shape, once completed, switch shapes and do the reverse, continuously switch shapes  
jump from one interval to another, do sequence of various intervals, jump from interval to base note with interval moving with shape (and bass to maybe)  
**Finger proprioception**  
Jump individual fingers, finger combinations, or altering fingers through octaves, chords, scales, and other shapes. Work on all in parallel.  
**Finger independence**  
Master the following at max speeds and all tempos and staccato and legato: quickly repeat a finger, all combinations of 2 finger and 1 finger alterations, combine both hands, quickly switch between various 2 and 2 finger alterations while progressing through shapes, chromatic scale (and other shapes) with all sequences of fingers as smoothly as possible moving up shape (or play n notes of scale then change the root by a sequence)  
Vary the dynamics per finger  
For most finger independence exercises, pretend like you’re pushing your finger through the surface as it trains you to play on keyboards with heavy action  
quickly playing a single note with single finger, control dynamics and rhythm (change position of other fingers on piano relative to playing finger)  
trills  
move finger intervals through shape is critical for really understanding chords and playing them fast. Master it, do it quickly amd smoothly for all intervals through all shapes  
hold one finger on piano key and move other finger between two notes (great for 45 and 34 and 345). make sound quality very consistent  
play interval descending n degrees through scale after n jump an octave and continue  
Trills and tremelos between all combinations of fingers (1 finger to 1 finger and 1 finger to 2 fingers)

For every combination of fingers repeated as fast as possible, then try it with some rhythm, combine both hands, do a different rhythm per hand or different finger combination, alternate between finger combinations, try with mixture of legato staccato and marcato  
Hold n fingers constant and alternate between the other fingers  
Where letters represent fingers 1-5: abe ab abd ab abc, abe ab ae abd ab ad abc ab ac  
Where numbers index combinations in left hand and letter index combinations in right hand: 1a 1b 2b, 1a 1b 2a 1b 1a 2b

Double notes: trill one voice and every 3 notes play the other voice  
Chopin op. 10 no. 2: left and right hand  
Chopin op. 25 no. 6: some fingerings are 14-25 13-25 24-15 13-24  
Liszt op. 139 no. 5 (transcendental etude feux follets): play the high voice legato and low voice staccato

**Wrist rotation**  
playing neighboring notes, 51 511 5111 15 155 1555 1515, 54 legato

### Shape piece

For shapes built from a small number of small intervals  
Play as grace notes in some sequence land on the final note repeat the pattern by a sequence

### Chord

Foundations: chords made of intervals, chords based on scale degrees, chord symbols  
Alterations: sus, 6 chords, replacing notes, omitting notes (power chords, less tension), adding notes  
Processing speed: alternate base notes, stacking chords (easier to process than complex chord symbols), polychords

Memorize all 3 and 4 note chords, then learn how to play any technique given any 3 or 4 note chord.  
Chords with similar intervals sound similar (minor and major) and there is less ability to distinguish them.  
internalize each chord, then learn which chords go to each scale  
**Chords:**   
Start with min maj dim aug dim7 min7b5 min7 maj7 dom aug7 minmaj7  
trichord, tetrachord, every secundal chord of 3 notes, octaves with interval, every interval  
12 × 12 (mm Mm mM MM mmm mMm mmM mMM Mmm MMm MmM MMM) × 6inv \+ 12 × 5 (min maj dim aug sus2 sus4) × 3inv \+ 12 × 9 (min7 dim dimo maj7 min∆7 dom aug∆7 aug7 minaug∆7\) × 8inv. 

**Memorize chords:**   
Internalize every modification (sharp and flat), their sub chord, and their inversions, and their chromatic movement along any scale. Arpeggios, finger exercises, jumps from n fingers, combine hands, jump to inverted and shifted chord  
Treat like sight reading: pick chord quality and inversion for each hand, move each hand through sequence playing that chord eventually changing the inversion and octave everytime. Load as much as you can into working memory, play as quickly as possible allowing a few mistakes (just like sight reading).  
also change chord qualities every chord from arbitrary sequence  
play each chord in shape  
for a shape, play chord in shape then move one note forward (normally right most finger then second right most or 2 right most notes or other patterns) be aware of what chord and inversion is going to be next  
play chord progression. once resolve change next target chord by sequence (chord progression, scale, chromatic)

chord, inversion, left and right hand jumps to inversions contrary and parallel, octave movements, interval jumps and movements, inversions more than an octave  
**Chord techniques** (the following with every combination between hands in parallel and contrary): inversion (root to 1 to 2 and root to 2 to 1\) both within an octave and more than an octave (135  \-\> 153 or 145 \-\> 4 1 5\) (for inversions name chord based on new root), jumps, note accents and even playing, broken chords, arpeggios, arpeggios with doubled notes, finger independence, various octaves on sequences built from chords, chromatic movements, alternate chord sequence with both hands, repeated notes, grace chords (a la prokofiev), alternate between two chords or arpeggios, play chord doubling the lowest note but play the middle notes an octave lower or higher (mereaux), play chord with highest or lowest note trill using a scale to connect notes in chord using chord notes as target notes, jumping n fingers along inversions or other jumps, playing outer octave and inner tremolo while inverting and shifting chord, arpeggio while chromatically shifting chord or inverting it  
**Connecting chords:** play chord jumping through all intervals (1 through 16 semitones and multiple octaves), play same chord changing root from sequence of shape, play all chords built from 2s 3s 4s of pool, what chords are closely associated to which scales, also how to move from one chord to another, what voicings connect what chords, what sequences connect what chords, what chords are harmonically similar, functional roles of chords. Create various chord progressions utilizing all chords and play in all transpositions and various inversions. Play sequence of chord qualities and inversions and octaves different in each hand

Memorize all chords and scales to open your palette.
