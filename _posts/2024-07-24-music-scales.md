Super Ultra Hyper Mega Meta Scales
Metalydian is a symmetric pattern that does not repeat each octave (WWWH)

Mix up scales:
- Mixolydian Lydian
- M3 m6 M7
- m3 M6 M7
- Phrygian M3

## Messiaen modes
1. Whole tone, 2 transpositions, 1 mode
2. Diminished, 3 transpositions, 2 modes
3. WHHWHHWHH (1 2 ♭3 3 ♯4 5 6 ♭7), 3 transpositions, 2 modes
4. H-H-3H-H-H-H-3H-H, 6 transpositions, 4 modes
5. H-4H-H-H-4H-H, 6 transpositions, 3 modes
6. W-W-H-H-W-W-H-H, 6 transpositions, 4 modes
7. H-H-H-W-H-H-H-H-W-H, 6 transpositions, 5 modes

Truncation:
Removing notes from a mode to leave a truncated mode. The removed notes and remaining notes must preserve the symmetry of the parent mode.
Mode 7 and 3 are not truncated modes, the other modes can be constructed from them or from one or more of their modes. Mode 7 contains 1 2 3 4 5 6, mode 6 contains 1 5, mode 4 contains 5, mode 3 contains 1.

## 5 note scales
5 note scales are generally more thought of melodically, connecting various harmonic contexts. A collection of intervals that tie together various harmonies starting and ending harmonically arbitrarily, instead appealing to need. One is not so concerned with forming chords from these small scales, instead one should explore chords and their variations in their own right.

**9th chord**: 1 3 5 7 9

Major pentatonic has 5 consecutive pitches from the circle of fifths transposed within the same octave.

**Pentatonic**:

major: 1 2 3 5 6 (Lydian Ionian Mixolydian)
blues major: 1 2 4 5 6 (Mixolydian Dorian Aeolian)
suspended: 1 2 4 5 ♭7 (Dominant Dorian Aeolian)
minor: 1 ♭3 4 5 ♭7 (Dorian Aeolian Phygian)
blues minor: 1 ♭3 4 ♭6 ♭7 (Aeolian Phygian Locrian)

**Hirajoshi**: 1 3 ♯4 5 7	2W-W-H-2W-H	(0,4,6,7,11)
**Miyako-bushi on D**: 1 ♭2 4 5 ♭6	H-2W-W-H-2W	(0,1,5,7,8)

**Iwato**: 1 ♭2 4 ♭5 ♭7	H-2W-H-2W-W	(0,1,5,6,10)

## 6 note scales
**Blues**: [(b)] 1 ♭3 4 ♭5 5 ♭7	3H-W-H-H-3H-W	(0,3,5,6,7,10)
    - Minor chord with chromatic passing note between 4 and 5 and no 2 or 6 (to avoid clashing with 3 and 5)
**Augmented**: 1 ♭3 3 5 ♯5 7	3H-H-3H-H-3H-H	(0,3,4,7,8,11)
    - 3 Major chords and 3 Minor chords
**Tritone**: [(+)♭7♭9♯11] 1 ♭2 3 ♭5 5 ♭7	H-3H-W-H-3H-W	(0,1,4,6,7,10)
    - Two major chords a tritone away
**Whole tone**: 1 2 3 ♯4 ♯5 ♯6	W-W-W-W-W-W	(0,2,4,6,8,10)
    - also: 1 2 3 ♭5 ♯5 ♭7
    - similar to augmented scale
**Scale of harmonics**: 1 ♭3 3 4 5 6	3H-H-H-W-W-3H	(0,3,4,5,7,9)
**Istrian**: 1 ♭2 ♭3 ♭4 ♭5 5	H-W-H-W-H-5H	(0,1,3,4,6,7)
**Prometheus**: 1 2 3 ♯4 6 ♭7	W-W-W-3H-H-W	(0,2,4,6,9,10)
**Two-semitone tritone**: 1 ♭2 ♮2 ♯4 5 ♭6	H-H-4H-H-H-4H	(0,1,2,6,7,8)

## Major
**Lydian**: [(+)♯11] 1 2 3 ♯4 5 6 7	W-W-W-H-W-W-H	(0,2,4,6,7,9,11)
> I II iii ♯iv⁰ V vi vii
> Lydian augmented: [(+)♯5♯11] 1 2 3 ♯4 ♯5 6 7	W-W-W-W-H-W-H	(0,2,4,6,8,9,11)
> Lydian dominant: [(+)♭7♯11] 1 2 3 ♯4 5 6 ♭7	W-W-W-H-W-W-H	(0,2,4,6,7,9,10)

**Ionian**: [(+)] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7	W-W-H-W-W-W-H	(0,2,4,5,7,9,11)
    - I ii iii IV V vi vii⁰
    - Consonant with first 6 harmonics (the seventh harmonic is a minor seventh)
**Mixolydian**: [(♭7)] 1 2 3 4 5 6 ♭7	W-W-H-W-W-H-W	(0,2,4,5,7,9,10)
    - I ii iii⁰ IV v vi ♭VII
    - Becuase there is only ♭7, only every other chord is changed (1, 2, 4, 6) stay the same because they don't involve 7
    - Consonant with first 10 harmonics (the 11th harmonic is a tritone)
    - Flat 7 gives less direction
    - Chords are less resolved
    - More relaxed and ambiguous
    - Straying from root gives less tension
    **Mixolydian ♭6**: [(♭7)♭6], [(-)♯3] 1 2 3 4 5 ♭6 ♭7	W-W-H-W-W-H-W	(0,2,4,5,7,8,10)
**Dorian**: [(-)♯13] 1 2 ♭3 4 5 6 ♭7	W-H-W-W-W-H-W	(0,2,3,5,7,9,10)
    - i ii ♭III IV v vi⁰ ♭VII
    - Step from 3 to 4 is larger and increases brightness
**Aeolian**: [(-)] 1 2 ♭3 4 5 ♭6 ♭7	W-H-W-W-H-W-W	(0,2,3,5,7,8,10)
    - i ii⁰ ♭III iv v ♭VI ♭VII
    - Relative natural minor
    - Lowest interval that respects the circle of fifths
    **Aeolian ♭5**: [(♭5)] 1 2 ♭3 4 ♭5 ♭6 ♭7
**Phrygian**: [(-)♭9] 1 ♭2 ♭3 4 5 ♭6 ♭7	H-W-W-W-H-W-W	(0,1,3,5,7,8,10)
    - i ♭II ♭III iv v⁰ ♭VI ♭vii
    - Notes are fairly same distance which leads to a slippery slope towards the root
**Locrian**: [(♭5)♭9] 1 ♭2 ♭3 4 ♭5 ♭6 ♭7	H-W-W-H-W-W-W	(0,1,3,5,6,8,10)
    - i⁰ ♭II ♭iii iv ♭V ♭VI ♭vii
    - The two halfs before the 5
    - Doesn't respect circle of fifths
    - Tritone between the 1 and 5
    **Locrian ♯2**: [(♭5)] 1 2 ♭3 4 ♭5 ♭6 ♭7	W-H-W-H-W-W-W	(0,2,3,5,6,8,10)
    **Super locrian**: [(♭5)♭9♭11] 1 ♭2 ♭3 ♭4 ♭5 ♭6 ♭7 H-W-H-W-W-W-H (0,1,3,4,6,8,10)
    **Major Locrian**: [(♭5)♯3], [(+)♭5♭7♭13] 1 2 3 4 ♭5 ♭6 ♭7	W-W-H-H-W-W-W	(0,2,4,5,6,8,10)

**Melodic minor (Jazz Minor)**: [(+)♭3] 1 2 ♭3 4 5 6 7	W-H-W-W-W-W-H	(0,2,3,5,7,9,11)
    **Acoustic scale**: 1 2 3 ♯4 5 6 ♭7

- Minor := 1-2.3-4-5.6-7-8
    - Natural := ♭3 ♭6 ♭7
        - Whole step between 7 and 8 didn't provide the right tension
    - Harmonic := ♭3 ♭6
        - 3 half steps between 6 and 7
    - Melodic := ♭3
        - 1 whole step between 6 and 7
