What are identity types, path space objects, etc.?

Homotopy type theory provides a looser but much more descriptive notion of equality.

Homotopy type theory is a flavor of intensional dependent type theory. Intensional type theory means identity types can have complex structure, representing (‚àû,1)-categorical semantics therefore representing more nuanced forms of equality. Viewing types as type families, each term is assigned a space.

In contrast to homotopy theory, homotopy type theory provides a synthetics description of points and paths as opposed to the analytic description.

? How does one abstract statements to say, fields? What does a statement using assumptions look like in a (‚àû,1)-topos. A field, for example, is a collection of axioms, or function types. Take addition, we have $‚àè_{x,y: ùîΩ} x+y‚ààùîΩ$. We can then label a Field as the collection of axioms .
$+$ and $√ó$ are type constructors of $ùîΩ$.

‚àû-topos is like the ‚àû-category of sheaves on a space. Homotopy type theory provides semantics for type theory via ‚àû-topos. (‚àû,1)-internal category amounts to doing homotopy theory. Transport. Theorem proovers.

The path object and identity type and 1-morphisms allow mapping the categorical morphism structure to the underlying infinity groupoid structure. By viewing automorphisms and similar on a type, we can view the higher equivalences as data on how the internal elements relate.

The identity type is the collection of paths from a point to itself.

Homotopy information encodes how underlying points relate to each other.

In HoTT, we have path space objects which represent the collection of morphisms between two types. This can be interpreted as a collection of embeddings.

In the homotopy interpretation, types are viewed as ‚àû-groupoids which have complex higher structure which leads to points being equivalent in multiple ways.

# Key concepts
Homotopy type theory serves as the internal language for (‚àû,1)-topos. Objects are types or spaces, viewed as constructions or collections of points. Morphisms are continuous maps between spaces with groupoid structures representing higher homotopies between these continuous maps. Types can be constructed, resulting in higher inductive types, which can be viewed as more complex topological spaces. The homotopies represent topological structures.
Types are represented as ‚àû-groupoids, which signify how points are connected through homotopies.

Voevodsky's univalence axiom represents object classifiers in (‚àû,1)-categorical semantics.
Higher inductive types allows for the construction of (‚àû,1)-colimits, cell complexes, truncations, localizations, and other objects which are constructed in homotopy theory using the small object argument.

# Inductive types and higher inductive types
(Higher) inductive types have point constructors and path or higher constructors. Point constructors essentially limit the view to a constructors of elements of a set. Higher constructors enact the higher groupoid view, and allow expressing higher-dimensional structure of points. Inductive types allow freely generating types. The (higher) inductive property expresses generating every possible construction of a type, and expressing a proof of each construction. The fact that loops are not (a priori) equal to $refl_{base}$ is why $1$ is different from $ùïä‚ÇÅ$.

Fundamental to homotopy type theory, is the interpretation of types as spaces, and path types representing higher-dimensional information about the topology of these spaces, as opposed to set theory, which views sets (the fundamental object) as structureless bags. The fundamental group and groupoid represent the topological structure of a point and every point, respectively, of a type space. Type theory is the mathematical language that is used to communicate ideas, and category theory expresses the semantics of this language. Paths are fundamental to this language, and express how points in a space are equivalent. When discussing equality, one *must* consider the paths along with the points being considered, as this characterizes their equality.

Homotopy type theory is a formal language for mathematics which combines ideas from type theory, homotopy theory, category theory, and model theory. Type theory provides a syntax, homotopy theory provides intuition, and category ties everything together. The underlying semantics for homotopy type theory is that of an (‚àû,1)-topos, in which objects are spaces, morphisms express how objects are put together, and higher morphisms express higher dimensional equivalences. The topos structure allows one to do mathematics. The structure of an (‚àû,1)-topos provides is a nicer base than that of traditional set theory. In particular, there are fewer assumptions made.

# Model category
Model categories serve as the site for ‚àû-sheaves valued on ‚àû-groupoids.

Sheaves on these categories represent types and follow local/global principles of sheaves, representing homotopy analogs.

Quillen model categories are
