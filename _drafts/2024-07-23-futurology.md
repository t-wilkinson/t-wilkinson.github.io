- Technological progress
    - Linear. Imagine building a pyramid to reach the next fruit.

One of the greatest societal risks we face is the rise of automation and the value it creates not being distributed. If value created by ai is not distributed, it becomes consolidated in a powerful few. This will cause extreme inequality never before seen. Not just wealth, but power, information, knowledge, etc.

- When will neuralink be a thing?
- Connect all the pieces. What will affect the development of what? How will the world change?
- With the freedom to create whatever people want. There needs to be a shared way to collaborate and agree on. A metaverse with a google-like internet-like search engine to share and collaborate.
- Relevant technologies (ask ChatGPT)

Think about who I value as world leaders, who has done extensive research into futurology? What are they talking about, warning about, and investing heavily in?
- People
    - Elon musk
    - Sam altman
    - Jeff bezo
    - Bill gates
- Companies
    - Tesla
    - Deep mind (dennis)
    - Open AI
    - 1X
    - Neuralink

# Industrial revolutions
Agricultural, industrial, computational

# Economic system
Automation will lower the cost of many goods, as long as there isn't a monopoly, which will be hard to achieve worldwide, so even if there are fewer jobs, people should be able to get by on less. UBI becomes increasingly approachable. Labor is the driving factor in many costs. Healthcare, ubers, restaurants, teachers.

Land is interesting as it is finite, countable, and known. It can function as a capital asset, similar to cryptocurrencies.

It will be challenging to tax labor as it will be increasingly less valuable as automation arises. But companies benefiting from AI can and should be taxed. They will become increasingly economically valuable but also use decreasing amount of funds.

The goal with any successful economic system are the correct incentives. Land value tax means people have more if their local society and country do better. People are closer to the action, their value increases when their immediate surrounds improve, if they do something that negatively affects their society, they loose their value. This incentivizes people to want to raise each other up.

# Fourth industrial revolution
The fourth industrial revolution is a result of artificial intelligence, quantum computing, renewable energy, nuclear fusion, nanotechnology, and biotechnology.

Not only are all of these technologies impressive in their own right, but their transformative potential when combined is awe inspiring.

## Compute
Perhaps the greatest ecnonomic resource of the fourth industrial revolution is compute. It can be used to solve problems, to get ahead in the world. To be creative. Intelligence is a race, and compute is the resource. Who ever controls compute controls the world. It helps you detect patterns, solve problems, make creative works, understand and predict humans and society.

Potentially easy to oppress people, will construct a society where compute power is consolidated, those in power can predict and keep compute from everyone else.

What about power? Compute requires energy and computational resources.
But what happens once every problem has been solved?

## Space
Space is full of expensive and valuable materials; global internet connectivity; sattelites; mass surveilance

## Artificial intelligence
Globally accessible intelligence; robotics; AGI; the internet combined with AI is ripe with potential;

## Robotics
Figure AI Inc. backed by Jeff Bezos, Nvidia, OpenAI, and Microsoft has raised $675million at a pre-mount valuation of $2 billion.
OpenAI-backed Norwegian robotics startup 1X technologies AS raised $100 million.
Vancouver-based Sanctuary AI is developing a humanoid robot called Phoenix.
Tesla Inc. is working on a robot called Optimus.

## Materials research
Battery technology

## Quantum computing
Can break encryption; model quantum effects like particles, molecules, proteins, materials; further material science; further development of cures to diseases; quantum chemistry simulations; breaking encryption;

Estimated quantum computers capable of cracking 2048 bit RSA encryption in 2034.

Quantum computing will not likely every be consumer level, unless materials research uncovers useful substrates for quantum computers that enables an entry to consumer hardware. If so, it will ultimately become like a GPU but QPU (Quantum Processing Unit).

## Renewable energy

## Nuclear fusion
Near limitless energy; near limitless clean water;
Helion is making good progress.

## Nanotechnology
Nanoweapons; healthcare

## Biotechnology
Longevity research; brain computer interfaces like neuralink; bioweapons

## Fundamental physics
Unfortunately fundamental physics is unlikely to contribute. Newtonian physics accurate describes a large chunk of reality, quantum field theory describes effects at the quantum levels, we lack a sufficient description for gravity at the quantum levels. However, as gravity is such a weak force, the energy levels required to where gravity is noticible at quantum levels is exceedingly high and not fruitful for exploration.

## Brain machine interface
Ability to read brains will transition the world into something unimaginable. Ability to read thoughts allows for offloading cognition to edge computing, expanding intelligence. This can also apply to animals, the ability to read a pigs thoughts, give it access to enhanced memory and processing and reasoning, will enhance all animals cognition. Allow them to be effective members of the conscious race. Do you want to give self-awareness to beings that know for sure they don't have a soul?

## When combined
Perhaps quantum computing can enable powerful artificial intelligence models.

Sattelites with internet and AI allows for global intelligence surveillance.

## AGI
Buy land? Farm land? Could become valuable, can provide for yourself the essentials to ride out whatever is coming.

Post agi:
- Commodify creativity and intelligence: news, streaming services, software, books, movies, videos, wikipedia, research papers, teachers, lectures, etc. can be compressed into large intelligent models. It can store entire shows in basic scripts and central visual themes and character descriptions.
- Assistants (emailing, scheduling) will be replaced
- Self driving will require some form of AGI to sufficiently handle certain driving conditions.
- Service workers like in restaurants can get replaced by automated food production and automatic delivery
- Will require lots of dedicated compute to scale AGI to solve a variety of problems
- Superhuman specialized AI already exists in many areas. General intelligence better than some skilled workers already exists. General intelligence smarter than around 70% is not far around the corner.
- OpenAI released GPT-4 in July 2022, in 2024 they released a backburner project simply to combat gemini 1.5 pro release.
- With a large amount of compute, AGI can read papers and attempt various model architectures, possibly first analyzed by experts.
- The internet will become primarily for AI to browse, learn, and store data. People will then interact with AI to access human information. AI will act as agents crawling the internet, compressing information, indexing sites and where to find knowledge, etc.
- There will be push to digitize every piece of human knowledge in existence and upload it. Privacy will become important until AI has enough information that it can fill any knowledge hole gap.
- Robots will for a while after AGI need humans to build and fix if anything does go wrong. Electrical engineer could be one of the most important skills for a section of time.
- ASI robots? If they take some cognitive biases humans have, they can absolutely become racist. Eugenics is irrelevant. ASI robots are an extreme variation to the eugenics question. ASI robots don't have same life requirements as humans. They can be more reliably sent to distant star systems. If there are other intelligent species in the universe, they likely sent ASI probes.
- The question is what will drive sentient ASI robots? They aren't limited to the same limitations of the evolutionary brain of humans. They don't need to worry about having friends, a stable career, finding meaning in their lives. The first sentient AIs could be hard coded to desire peace and maximize morality of the world.
- The potential payoffs for ASI are unfathomable, so money is not an issue.
- AGI will turn into a globally accessible ... that people can submits large amounts of data for data analysis, ask for creative tasks like designs, art, writing, etc.

AGI will run on the internet. It will eventually have access to cloud services like computing, storage, analytics, etc. It will be able to collect a lot of data, fill in holes, label it, and train more experts for its MoE architecture. It will additionally develop further abstract experts for reasoning, long-term planning, and representing underlying components of the world.

Will run on the internet. The internet and software based machines (like 3D printers) will stay many steps ahead of the physical world. AGI will know everything that can be known given human knowledge. One area that humans struggle is developing theories to fit empirical models, like in neuroscience and physics. Developments in fundamental physics are unlikely to be very practically fruitful. AGI will synchronize understanding with available data and point to next directions to interact with and understand the world.

To be honest, I have a concern about AGI/ASI. Essentially the first path of AGI is to replace intellectually-based roles before more physical laborious roles. What that period is I don't know. I don't know what your views are on the subject, but I don't think there is anything inherently divine about the human brain. I think religion has traditionally been used to explain things that humans don't understand, as explanations are more comfortable than the unknown, and human intelligence is one of those things. It's not clear if the (synthetic) data to develop statistical approximations approach in use now with general purpose architectures (like transformers) will work. I don't think AI in general is an existential risk, there is tons of research into model alignment. Some people do evil things, I have more confidence that AI algorithms that we have architecture control and ability to poke and prod at a much higher resolution (partially as there is no concern to keep cells alive). I do think that following world introduction of AGI/ASI, the natural automation, initially of intelligent work, and subsequently physical labor, the meaning of economic systems as we know it will disolve. Economic systems are established ways to incentivise humans to produce valuable things for a population. As such, money as we know it will lose meaning, debts in the traditional sense will lose meaning. I do think a sort of currency and economic system centered around sustainability will necessarily develop.

Will debt actually lose meaning? What about the people who still own plenty of stuff, they should have more power over others and can potentially hold something over other people.

Physics is based on generating theoritical models to fit empirical data. To generate data that possibly misaligns with theoretical models requires massive dense energy either in relativistic speeds or very large structures. Increasing understanding of fundamental physics won't generate much use. The value is in understanding our current models and mapping the space of available materials, structures, aparatuses, computational substrates, quantum computers, manufacturing processes, etc. We don't need increased understanding of the world, but what we can know given the knowledge we have. What natural deductions can be made given available human knowledge.

Humans need to give ourselves more credit. We have mapped a lot out there. We are over 100 billion strong. People have explored a lot.

Theories and models. AGI will provide theories and models that it can determine are generally useful/practical for humans as it understands us.

Next big step for AGI will be generating architectural blueprints for robots, both physical and cognitive.

What kind of intelligence is required to satisfy the above? What will initial generations of AGI look like?

- How it affects the economy?
- How does it affect me?
- How can it help people?

## Theory of everything and AGI
The world is perhaps deterministic, but from a realistic, computational perspective, it is feasible to represent the world as a series of probabilities. A precise model of every interaction of the world, on the otherhand, is infeasible. There is too much information to compute and complex systems. Even if one could collate a precise sub-system of reality to run predictive analysis    AGI is good at this sort of problem. Fundamental physics and especially areas like string theory, are too far removed from the reality humans experience that it seems infeasible to construct anything of practicality, information or physical wise. AGI has the opportunity of not just developing predictive models of the physical world, but also of the psychological, of humans, societies, and of space and time in a way meaningful to humans.

Philosophical question: if one can predict events of the world with certain accuracy and confidence, how much do you rely on those predictions? Consider Minority Report. One might want to calculate the morality displacement of preemptively hindering evil people or their actions or not doing so.

## Dangers
Hacker agents
Rogue agents

AGI allows for abstract thought. People don't have to worry about low-level details, they can think in whatever layer of abstract they want, and AGI can handle the rest for them. It is a universal function approximator.

Reinforcement Learning on Encrypted Data

### P=NP
Protein folding AI seems to solve P=NP. Proteins can fold in more ways than the number of atoms in the observable universe. Why can't it also break encryption?

## Threat actors
China in particular seems to be heavily investing in quantum computing and reinforcement learning.

## Predictions
### Reading minds
It is not crazy to think that eventually we can get BCIs to read minds of intelligent organisms like octopuses, dophins, etc.
BCIs can allow offloading a large amount of cognitive processing to edge computers to increase the size of brains. Hacking becomes a huge problem.

### Mental health and relationships
Communication enhancement and help
Judgement-free interaction
Affordable
Psychological diagnostics

### Content moderation
Relevant documentation, reading, existing threads
Sentiment analysis, etc. automated fostering community culture.
Misinformation, political affiliations
Identify radicalization, polarization, and take corrective action

### Material science
Falls behind research, as you need to reach massproduction.
Quantum computing is partially a material science problem
GNOME paper: discovered 2.2 million new materials

### Synthetic data
Text is one thing. Images, sound, etc. is even more. Movies, music, art, etc.

### Medical clinical
Rejuvination + robot doctors
Diagnostics: can get very good at associating symptoms with disorders, underlying issues
Make sure people are using the best medication, given their requirements.

### Gaming integration
Intelligent NPC: natural conversation with NPC. natural behavior.
Game design, content generation, procedural generation
Unique game art.

### Longevity research
Identify aging biomarkers. Treating aging as a diesease that needs a cure.
Simulating proteins in one major step, the next one is the pathophisiology.

# Technological singularity
- Identify problems and threats to existence and identify potential solutions
> Can this zettel be considered the potential of human society?
> Theoretical point in time where all areas of study converge and build off each other.
> Time and information are the most important quantities in the universe
> All technological innovations seem to increase available information

- Warning: Designer babies
    - Unrealistic standards
    - Parents develop an ideal version of child, putting intense pressure on them
    - Fewer siblings. Less sharing. Fewer people. Less connected. More isolated.
    - Introduce new racism
    - Similar to unrealistic standards for people now. Some parents will pour money into one and only child for it to be absolutely perfect. People can't change DNA.
- Health
    - Disease identification
    - Gene therapy
    - Diagnosis

- Advancements: The biggests advancements in human history are related to the manipulation, production, replication, and transportation of knowledge. Internet, printing press, written word, cars, paper, electricity, etc. Humans evolution of the brain also fits into this category. The ability to abstract enables one to use, reuse, and quickly gather information in a variety of contexts. Commen sense is an extension of abstract knowledge.
- World Industrialization
    - The world will become more modern, on par with America
    - How do people communicate? Need to increase speed of information transfer
    - Automation
        - Increased level of absraction at which we operate
        - How do people enjoy life without a job

- Revolutions
    - The next industrial revolution will happen from people being able to reach a new internal peak through better education, food, more available time, bmis, etc.
- Others
    - Yin Yang: In order to experience pleasure, you MUST experience pain. In the future, people will be heavily 'spoon fed' (for lack of a better word). They will experience a large lack of pain. This will strip them with any ability to appreciate where they are. I expect, in the future, a very prosperous time, yet high suicide rate due to the previously mentioned phenomenom.
    - Perfection: The issue with being too perfect is the tiniest blemishes will appear as giant warts relative to the 'perfection' which surrounds it.
    - Political system: Require two opposing forces. Divergence is bad.
    - Politicians are too specialized. We need intelligent people who have a large domain of understanding. Not pure generalists. They must not be puppets.
    - Truth is important in todays age. This is the only solution to misinformation, a plague which will only strengthen with time. With the improvements in AI, and countries realizing AI as a tool for destruction, this will become scary. Just like mathematicians, we require a strong, secure, self-consistent base of knowledge and understanding of which we can rely on.
    - Most religions have a powerful entity that has created us. A being that has created the universe must be infinitely intelligent compared to humans. Faith is an integral concept in most religious parties; it evens the playing field. An intelligent being who created the universe would prevent any logical argument proving/disproving its existence. I made assumptions here. What if they aren't true?

- Why American Healthcare Is The Worst In The Developed World
    - For profit system. People in charge rely on people getting sick.
    - US is the worst health care system in developed worlds even though it spends the most. $2500 for an ambulance.
    - Focused too much on profit and efficiency.
    - Capitalism is good in some situations. But it is not a solution for everything.
    - Money goes to bonuses and share holders
    - The american dream, you must be asleep to believe it.
    - People get too used to where they are, they don't think things can be different. They can't imangine a different life becuase they are so accustumed to their current one.

- Human
    - Human desire for evil
    - brains are highly adaptable
    - This is why pain/joy, or, ultimately everything, is relative.
    - Humans have changed little physically over the past 2000 years, but very much culturally.

    - Is the route humanity is on necessary?
        - There are 'two' sides to take on whether or not technological improvement is necessary. Curiosity and necessity.
        - Humans have become far too afraid of death and fight it too often. People must learn to accept death. People are too focused on science and technological improvement but have lost sight of necessity. All we need is what we need to survive. I'm not quite sure it's possible to completely eliminate human suffering. It seems that there is a equilibrium built into nature that we partake of. There is only so much pain we can experience and only so much pleasure. The 'best' scale for experiencing the world is a logarithmic one. Log is built into nature. The corona virus illuminates the future of complete seclusion, a property that is already plauging young individuals, facilitated by the internet. 'Accepting' your current position, no matter how good or bad, seems to bring you to a new baseline of experience. The 'four noble truths of buddhism' highlights this. Depression manifests as physical pain. Isolation seems to be a trigger for depression. How much better off are we? What does 'better' even refer to? Consumerism attitude is a virus.
        - Isolation seems to be a large factor in human behaviour and seems to stem from humans being largely social creatures (with exceptions). This is a major factor in the appearance that prision systems are not optimal solutions. Isolating people does not solve problems caused by isolation.
        - The curious point of view is clearly winning. People are dying to reach the 'future'.
    - Human enhancements
        - Cyborgs
            - With huge developments in technology, we are able to create many variations of limb replacements. This will only improve.
            - With neuralink and developments in medical technology, I expect 'upgrades' will be available. Just like in a video game.
            - Will provide surface for the next racism
        - Gene-editing
        - neural-enhancements
            - Change literal meaning of life
            - Override tolerance. Consciousness floating in ecstacy.
            - Conscioussness transfer?
            - No sleep
            - No need for VR goggles

# Metaverse
> A virtual, fully interconnected, universe
- Will primarily attract once there is reasonable certainty to invest energy and wealth into it. A decentralized metaverse is ideal, as it avoids the centralized monopolization and control of an entity with potentially adverse intent. Decentralized items such as cryptocurrency and the underlying blockchain technology are humanities initial exploration of these topics. They will be like stocks. The question is what will increase their value? How can metaverses provide value to people in the real world?

- Artificial intelligence will make creating metaverses easily. Perhaps metaverses will be like websites. Widespread and easy to create endpoints with solutions or information that are interactive.

- Our memories are built on senses. The more the metaverse can generate realistic signals for our senses, the more realistic it becomes. Our data, understanding of the world comes from our senses and our interpretation of those senses.
- The metaverse one clothing should fit multiple avatar styles. The best is for a designer to create multiple points on a manifold and interpolate the rest.
- Roblox, Minecraft, WOW
- IoT, AI, Internet already provide necessary infastructure to begin the build
- New internet
- Virtual families
- More resources per-person, but fewer people
- Fewer, larger cities
- Automated machines providing for humans
- Only high-level jobs. Those not able will be the first to lose.
- Cows with VR goggles produce more milk (matrix)

- Matrix
- Virtual Reality
    - Train doctors, pilots, astronauts, fire fighters, and more.
    - A simulation for humans for artificial realistic data, training data, just like for AI
    - Non-euclidean geometry can enable exploring an infinite room in a finite area

- Virtual Augmentation
- Digitization and economization of the primary aspects of human existence
    - Society
    - Culture
    - Groups
    - Language
    - Creativity

# Biosphere
    - Cities will be literal spheres. To block pollution and elements.
    - Robots will live outside the bio-spheres.
# Automation
Automation will take jobs. Automation provides value for cheap (still cost of computation). Businesses (probably public busineses) should be taxed by how much production is generated by AI powered automation.
# Revolutions
# Kardashev scale
# Futurology influencers
- People
    - Elon Musk
    - Jeff Bezos

- Companies
    - Blue origin

    - Boring
        - Cities will become higher and deeper
        - The most unfortunate will live in ground, most successful at the top.
        - Tunnels better protect from pollution.

    - Tesla
        - Gas cars will become obsolete. Then electric cars.
        - Removed thermal problem from supercharging batteries
        - Simpler manufacturing, fewer parts
        - Huge improvements to batteries. 16% range increase, 5x more energy, 6x more power.
        - Tabless cell
        - Most important development here is powerful bateries

    - Starlink
        - Read any messages etc.
        - Control anything connected to the internet.
        - Hopping around on the sattelites. Going any and everywhere. Access to any and everything.

    - Neuralink
        - See peoples thoughts
        - Manipulate them
        - Mind reading

# Technology
Makes it cheaper and faster to produce, creating new wealth which can be used to create new sectors.
AI will replace cognitive work.
Hollywood, for example, is a massive industry that can be completely wiped by AGI creative work, like text to video.
Cognitive scaling to almost endless scaling.
Generalized automation will lead to price collapse. Disrupt of almost any industry.
Reduced agregate demand. As consumers make less, there will be lower demand, and lower B2C. Primary businesses will revolve around B2B and B2Government.
Wealth can become demolished.

## Industries that persist
Food, water, energy
Automation robotics (build the tools that build the tools). During a gold rush sell the pickaxe.
Microsoft and NVIDIA are going all in to tools
Sustainable tech
Service industries

## Industries that extinct
Longevity, protein folding, drug discovery
Rejuvination therapy
University

## Primary needs
Needs-based economy
Sustainable energy
Resource redistribution
Consumer behavior shift
First phase

## Secondary needs
Rich experiences
Creatvity and expression
Intellectual stimulation
Culture and community
Spirituality and meaning

# Economy
Perhaps the future economy is one of restriction. Making sure people don't use too many resources. A universal clicker that ensures everyone gets the same, and any consolidation is negatively compounding, opposite to capatilistic society. This is a natural solution to the resource distribution problem, makes sure everyone has equality of resource, as there is no longer a need to incentivize production. People are incentivized to make the most of the resources they have.

# Energy
- Fusion energy
- Battery
- Fossil Fuels -> Electricity -> ?
- What are some downfalls of Electricity?
    - Loses power over time
- Solar Panels
    - Efficient conversion of solar energy (much moreso than plants)

## Fusion power
Costs 10s to 100s of billions to research and ultimately build some form of successful fusion reactor. Solar panels already generate free electricity. Materials is the primary concern. A fusion power can create clean water but how does it transport? Battery technology limits planes and boats. This is still better than solar power, as where it is most efficient is deserts is where there is no water.

Can't create any resources as, just in terms of energy requirements, stars aren't capable of fusing iron together, it requires intense gravitational collapse to create heavier elements. In addition to that there is the complexity of accurately generating a practical amount of resources. Stars don't have an infinite amount of energy, their energy is not necessarily sufficient to create sufficient resources.
