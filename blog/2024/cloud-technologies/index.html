Hypervisors allow creating virtual machines which allow running operating systems on top of. Type-1 hypervisors run on bare metal while Type-2 hypervisors run on top of an existing operating system. Type-1 are more geared towards enterprises and Type-2 are for end-users.</p> <p>Type-1 hypervisor:</p> <ul> <li>AWS Nitro</li> <li>IBM z/VM</li> <li>Microsoft Hyper-V</li> <li>Nutanix AHV</li> <li>Oracle VM Server for SPARC</li> <li>Oracle VM Server for x86</li> <li>Red Hat Virtualization</li> <li>VMware ESXi</li> <li>Xen</li> </ul> <p>Type-2 hypervisor:</p> <ul> <li>Parallels Desktop for Mac</li> <li>VirtualBox</li> <li>VMware Player</li> <li>VMware Workstation.</li> </ul> <p>Type-1 and Type-2 hypervisor:</p> <ul> <li>KVM</li> <li>bhyve</li> </ul> <h2 id="kvm">KVM</h2> <p>Kernel-based Virtual Machine is a hardware-assisted virtualization software solution for Linux on x86 hardware (but it has been ported to other architectures). It allows for device abstraction for network interfaces, disks, but not the processor. It is a loadable kernel module which can insert itself between the hardware and KVMs guest operating system. Various hardware virtualization extensions must be supported by processors to work. It also supports overcommitting and hotpluggable devices.</p> <h2 id="vagrant">Vagrant</h2> <p>Vagrant is a solution to using virtual machines in a development environment, providing reproducibility, transparency, easy management of multiple projects, sharing development environments, and consistent environments across various hypervisors (even cloud provided ones). Vagrant primarily relies on a Vagrantfile which functions similar to a Dockerfile, but describing entire (multi) operating system environments. One can specify hardware, operating system, programs to install, persistent volumns and shared files, networking, and even specify multiple operating systems and how they interact, opposed to applications in Docker. Vagrant can switch hyperviser providers, allowing one to use type-1 or type-2 hypervisors, allowing development on local computers or just as easily on a cloud provider.</p> <h1 id="storage-options">Storage options</h1> <p>Boot disk:<br> Persistent: high availability<br> Local SSD:<br> Cloud storage: huge capacity. cap read and write from multiple compute instances.</p> <h1 id="introduction-to-cloud-infrastructure-technologies-course-outline">Introduction to cloud infrastructure technologies course outline</h1> <ol> <li>Virtualization <ul> <li>Introduction and Learning Objectives</li> <li>KVM</li> <li>VirtualBox</li> <li>Vagrant</li> <li>Knowledge Check</li> </ul> </li> <li>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) <ul> <li>Introduction and Learning Objectives</li> <li>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</li> <li>Azure Virtual Machine</li> <li>DigitalOcean Droplet</li> <li>Google Compute Engine</li> <li>IBM Cloud Virtual Servers</li> <li>Oracle Cloud Compute Virtual Machines</li> <li>OpenStack</li> <li>Knowledge Check</li> </ul> </li> <li>Platform as a Service (PaaS) <ul> <li>Introduction and Learning Objectives</li> <li>Cloud Foundry</li> <li>Red Hat Openshift</li> <li>The Heroku Platform</li> <li>Knowledge Check</li> </ul> </li> <li>Containers <ul> <li>Introduction and Learning Objectives</li> <li>Containers</li> <li>Project Moby</li> <li>Knowledge Check</li> </ul> </li> <li>Containers: Micro OSes for Containers <ul> <li>Introduction and Learning Objectives</li> <li>Alpine Linux</li> <li>BusyBox</li> <li>Fedora CoreOS</li> <li>Flatcar Container Linux</li> <li>RancherOS and k3OS</li> <li>Ubuntu Core</li> <li>VMWare Photon OS</li> <li>Knowledge Check</li> </ul> </li> <li>Containers: Container Orchestration <ul> <li>Introduction and Learning Objectives</li> <li>Kubernetes</li> <li>Kubernetes Hosted Solutions and Platforms</li> <li>Docker Swarm</li> <li>Nomad by HashiCorp</li> <li>Cloud Container Orchestration Services</li> <li>Knowledge Check</li> </ul> </li> <li>Unikernels <ul> <li>Introduction and Learning Objectives</li> <li>Unikernels</li> <li>Knowledge Check</li> </ul> </li> <li>Microservices <ul> <li>Introduction and Learning Objectives</li> <li>Microservices</li> <li>Knowledge Check</li> </ul> </li> <li>Software-Defined Networking and Networking for Containers <ul> <li>Introduction and Learning Objectives</li> <li>Software-Defined Networking (SDN)</li> <li>Networking for Containers</li> <li>Docker Networking</li> <li>Podman Networking</li> <li>Kubernetes Networking</li> <li>Cloud Foundry: Container to Container Networking</li> <li>Knowledge Check</li> </ul> </li> <li>Software-Defined Storage and Storage Management for Containers <ul> <li>Introduction and Learning Objectives</li> <li>Ceph</li> <li>GlusterFS</li> <li>Docker Volumes</li> <li>Podman Volumes</li> <li>Kubernetes Volumes</li> <li>Cloud Foundry Volume Service</li> <li>Container Storage Interface (CSI)</li> <li>Knowledge Check</li> </ul> </li> <li>DevOps and CI/CD <ul> <li>Introduction and Learning Objectives</li> <li>CI/CD: Jenkins</li> <li>CI/CD: Travis CI</li> <li>CI/CD: Concourse</li> <li>Cloud Native CI/CD</li> <li>Knowledge Check</li> </ul> </li> <li>Tools for Cloud Infrastructure I (Configuration Management) <ul> <li>Introduction and Learning Objectives</li> <li>Ansible</li> <li>Puppet</li> <li>Chef</li> <li>Salt</li> <li>Knowledge Check</li> </ul> </li> <li>Tools for Cloud Infrastructure II (Build &amp;

They may lack features or force applications to be built in certain ways. Cloud servers should be considered ephemeral and failable, but also cheap and scalable. Cloud services, scaling, containerization, and orchestration should be viewed as exposing common necessary functionality for an internet-based service: DNS, storage, compute, servers, database, load-balancer, log, data analytics, monitoring, CDN, etc.</p> <p>Providers:<br> Azure is no-code focused<br> AWS is complicated but complete<br> GCP is a happy medium<br> Digital ocean has good api and ease of use</p> <p>There are also private providers like OpenStack which offers software for custom cloud servers, or in building bespoke cloud server setups.</p> <p>IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service; everything above the hardware is managed through software like operating system, applications, databases, application runtime, virtual network, servers, storage<br> PaaS: Platform as a Service; platform for running software is provided and managed and configured by user; user has access to applications, databases, application runtimes, application configuration.<br> SaaS: Software as a Service; software is provided and user can interact through the software to manage and configure it</p> <p>Terms:<br> Access to the cloud: CLI, website GUIs, SDK, API<br> Regions and availability zones: making services more redundant, lower latency, higher availability; geographic DNS region<br> Virtual private servers: pay for what you use per sec min or hour; easily scalable; can choose the images memory storage networking compute distro applications available; you can build your own images with Packer<br> Serverless: charged for compute time used; functions-as-a-service; docker containers, or supported programming languages exposing functions available to the serverless function are activated in response to some predefined trigger;<br> Networking: set address ranges of networks, define subnets, configure routes, set firewall rules, and construct VPNs to connect to external networks<br> Storage: object stores (files) like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage storage large amounts of data supporting mostly read access, block storage can be attached to compute instances, ephemeral; they also offer relational databases like MySQL, AWS Redshift, GCP BigQuery and in-memory and NoSQL databases like Redis or memcached<br> Identity and Access Management IAM: cloud services access should be provisioned accordingly<br> Automation: more complex topologies require verbose and error prone scripts, AWS CloudFormation and other platform equivalents allow providing a file description; Terraform and similar applications abstract and handle the verbosity and are platform agnostic<br> Cost control: compute time for load balancers servers databases etc., storage used, data transfer, up time;<br> - pay as you go is cheapest for very limited use, but it is the most expensive rate; on AWS and DigitalOcean it is usually chaged per hour, GCP is charged per minute; AWS can be difficult to calculate exact price as you must decide before hand the compute you want and how long, GCP decreases per week of usage, down to 60%; on demand services may not be available when requested, but provisioned resources are; AWS provides spot pricing, where participants declare max bids of compute time rates for processing-heavy workloads;<br> - network traffic can be hard to predict: websites reciving large file, image, video, pdf uploadss; replication intraregion iter-zone or inter-region for fault tolerance; storage that spans multiple regions</p> <h2 id="services">Services</h2> <p>Reviewing services not directly related to web servers could help with understanding futurology.</p> <p>Migrations: database, cloud</p> <p>Compute<br> - Container-based compute that enables auto scaling through serverless or automatically managed infrastructure<br> - Self-managed compute<br> - Automated compute for solutions like web apps based on Wordpress, or providing other similar common solutions.<br> - Heavy compute for heavy workloads (GPUs, TPUs, lots of RAM) for ML, scientific computing, 3D visualization<br> - Providing runtimes<br> - Serverless: App Engine, Cloud Run, AWS Lambda<br> - EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)<br> - Batch processing: GC Batch or AWS Batch<br> - Build containers<br> - Run containers<br> Containers: a self-contained packaged application that can run on any supporting virtual machine, is scalable horizontally or vertically, modular, and replicatable.<br> - Compute for containers<br> Content delivery<br> Database<br> - Cloud managed SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Sqlite) or custom SQL (Cloud SQL, AWS RDS)<br> - Cloud managed NoSQL (Redis, Memcached, Memorystore) or custom NoSQL (DynamoDB, ElastiCache)<br> Machine learning<br> Networking<br> - Common solutions like: CDN, DNS, Firewall, NAT, Load balancing, VPC, Domain management<br> Operations<br> Payment<br> Security, Identity, &amp;

If your function hasn’t been invoked recently, the first invocation may take longer as the environment is initialized.<br> For more complex or larger models, consider using Google Cloud Run or AI Platform Predictions, which can handle heavier workloads.</p> <p>By following these steps, you can deploy an open-source AI model to Google Cloud Functions and run inferences on-demand without maintaining a persistent server.</p> <p>For infrequent and sporadic AI model inferences, Google Cloud Functions or Google Cloud Run are typically the most cost-effective choices due to their per-invocation billing and ability to scale to zero, which means you don’t pay for anything when the services are not in use. They both offer a free tier, which can be sufficient for light workloads.</p> <p>AI Platform Predictions can be cost-effective if you leverage its features and scale, but it might be overkill for infrequent use unless you need its specific integrated services.</p> <p>Ultimately, the choice of product will depend on your specific requirements, such as the size and complexity of your AI model, the need for integration with other Google Cloud services, the expected latency, and your budget. The serverless options (Cloud Functions and Cloud Run) will generally offer the best cost savings for infrequent usage, while GKE and App Engine may offer more functionality and flexibility at a higher cost.</p> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/my-personal-notes/">My personal notes</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/my-favorite-pieces-of-music/">My favorite pieces of music</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/how-to-learn/">How to learn</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/music-insanity/">Music Insanity</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/music-scales/">Music Scales</a> </li> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Trey Wilkinson.
