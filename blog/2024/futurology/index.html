UBI becomes increasingly approachable. Labor is the driving factor in many costs. Healthcare, ubers, restaurants, teachers.</p> <p>Land is interesting as it is finite, countable, and known. It can function as a capital asset, similar to cryptocurrencies.</p> <p>It will be challenging to tax labor as it will be increasingly less valuable as automation arises. But companies benefiting from AI can and should be taxed. They will become increasingly economically valuable but also use decreasing amount of funds.</p> <p>The goal with any successful economic system are the correct incentives. Land value tax means people have more if their local society and country do better. People are closer to the action, their value increases when their immediate surrounds improve, if they do something that negatively affects their society, they loose their value. This incentivizes people to want to raise each other up.</p> <h1 id="fourth-industrial-revolution">Fourth industrial revolution</h1> <p>The fourth industrial revolution is a result of artificial intelligence, quantum computing, renewable energy, nuclear fusion, nanotechnology, and biotechnology.</p> <p>Not only are all of these technologies impressive in their own right, but their transformative potential when combined is awe inspiring.</p> <h2 id="compute">Compute</h2> <p>Perhaps the greatest ecnonomic resource of the fourth industrial revolution is compute. It can be used to solve problems, to get ahead in the world. To be creative. Intelligence is a race, and compute is the resource. Who ever controls compute controls the world. It helps you detect patterns, solve problems, make creative works, understand and predict humans and society.</p> <p>Potentially easy to oppress people, will construct a society where compute power is consolidated, those in power can predict and keep compute from everyone else.</p> <p>What about power?

It can store entire shows in basic scripts and central visual themes and character descriptions.</li> <li>Assistants (emailing, scheduling) will be replaced</li> <li>Self driving will require some form of AGI to sufficiently handle certain driving conditions.</li> <li>Service workers like in restaurants can get replaced by automated food production and automatic delivery</li> <li>Will require lots of dedicated compute to scale AGI to solve a variety of problems</li> <li>Superhuman specialized AI already exists in many areas. General intelligence better than some skilled workers already exists. General intelligence smarter than around 70% is not far around the corner.</li> <li>OpenAI released GPT-4 in July 2022, in 2024 they released a backburner project simply to combat gemini 1.5 pro release.</li> <li>With a large amount of compute, AGI can read papers and attempt various model architectures, possibly first analyzed by experts.</li> <li>The internet will become primarily for AI to browse, learn, and store data. People will then interact with AI to access human information. AI will act as agents crawling the internet, compressing information, indexing sites and where to find knowledge, etc.</li> <li>There will be push to digitize every piece of human knowledge in existence and upload it. Privacy will become important until AI has enough information that it can fill any knowledge hole gap.</li> <li>Robots will for a while after AGI need humans to build and fix if anything does go wrong. Electrical engineer could be one of the most important skills for a section of time.</li> <li>ASI robots? If they take some cognitive biases humans have, they can absolutely become racist. Eugenics is irrelevant. ASI robots are an extreme variation to the eugenics question. ASI robots don’t have same life requirements as humans. They can be more reliably sent to distant star systems. If there are other intelligent species in the universe, they likely sent ASI probes.</li> <li>The question is what will drive sentient ASI robots? They aren’t limited to the same limitations of the evolutionary brain of humans. They don’t need to worry about having friends, a stable career, finding meaning in their lives. The first sentient AIs could be hard coded to desire peace and maximize morality of the world.</li> <li>The potential payoffs for ASI are unfathomable, so money is not an issue.</li> <li>AGI will turn into a globally accessible … that people can submits large amounts of data for data analysis, ask for creative tasks like designs, art, writing, etc.</li> </ul> <p>AGI will run on the internet. It will eventually have access to cloud services like computing, storage, analytics, etc. It will be able to collect a lot of data, fill in holes, label it, and train more experts for its MoE architecture. It will additionally develop further abstract experts for reasoning, long-term planning, and representing underlying components of the world.</p> <p>Will run on the internet. The internet and software based machines (like 3D printers) will stay many steps ahead of the physical world. AGI will know everything that can be known given human knowledge. One area that humans struggle is developing theories to fit empirical models, like in neuroscience and physics. Developments in fundamental physics are unlikely to be very practically fruitful. AGI will synchronize understanding with available data and point to next directions to interact with and understand the world.</p> <p>To be honest, I have a concern about AGI/ASI. Essentially the first path of AGI is to replace intellectually-based roles before more physical laborious roles. What that period is I don’t know. I don’t know what your views are on the subject, but I don’t think there is anything inherently divine about the human brain. I think religion has traditionally been used to explain things that humans don’t understand, as explanations are more comfortable than the unknown, and human intelligence is one of those things. It’s not clear if the (synthetic) data to develop statistical approximations approach in use now with general purpose architectures (like transformers) will work. I don’t think AI in general is an existential risk, there is tons of research into model alignment. Some people do evil things, I have more confidence that AI algorithms that we have architecture control and ability to poke and prod at a much higher resolution (partially as there is no concern to keep cells alive). I do think that following world introduction of AGI/ASI, the natural automation, initially of intelligent work, and subsequently physical labor, the meaning of economic systems as we know it will disolve. Economic systems are established ways to incentivise humans to produce valuable things for a population. As such, money as we know it will lose meaning, debts in the traditional sense will lose meaning. I do think a sort of currency and economic system centered around sustainability will necessarily develop.</p> <p>Will debt actually lose meaning? What about the people who still own plenty of stuff, they should have more power over others and can potentially hold something over other people.</p> <p>Physics is based on generating theoritical models to fit empirical data. To generate data that possibly misaligns with theoretical models requires massive dense energy either in relativistic speeds or very large structures. Increasing understanding of fundamental physics won’t generate much use. The value is in understanding our current models and mapping the space of available materials, structures, aparatuses, computational substrates, quantum computers, manufacturing processes, etc. We don’t need increased understanding of the world, but what we can know given the knowledge we have. What natural deductions can be made given available human knowledge.</p> <p>Humans need to give ourselves more credit. We have mapped a lot out there. We are over 100 billion strong. People have explored a lot.</p> <p>Theories and models. AGI will provide theories and models that it can determine are generally useful/practical for humans as it understands us.</p> <p>Next big step for AGI will be generating architectural blueprints for robots, both physical and cognitive.</p> <p>What kind of intelligence is required to satisfy the above? What will initial generations of AGI look like?</p> <ul> <li>How it affects the economy?</li> <li>How does it affect me?</li> <li>How can it help people?</li> </ul> <h2 id="theory-of-everything-and-agi">Theory of everything and AGI</h2> <p>The world is perhaps deterministic, but from a realistic, computational perspective, it is feasible to represent the world as a series of probabilities. A precise model of every interaction of the world, on the otherhand, is infeasible. There is too much information to compute and complex systems. Even if one could collate a precise sub-system of reality to run predictive analysis AGI is good at this sort of problem. Fundamental physics and especially areas like string theory, are too far removed from the reality humans experience that it seems infeasible to construct anything of practicality, information or physical wise. AGI has the opportunity of not just developing predictive models of the physical world, but also of the psychological, of humans, societies, and of space and time in a way meaningful to humans.</p> <p>Philosophical question: if one can predict events of the world with certain accuracy and confidence, how much do you rely on those predictions? Consider Minority Report. One might want to calculate the morality displacement of preemptively hindering evil people or their actions or not doing so.</p> <h2 id="dangers">Dangers</h2> <p>Hacker agents<br> Rogue agents</p> <p>AGI allows for abstract thought. People don’t have to worry about low-level details, they can think in whatever layer of abstract they want, and AGI can handle the rest for them.

In the future, people will be heavily ‘spoon fed’ (for lack of a better word). They will experience a large lack of pain. This will strip them with any ability to appreciate where they are.

Curiosity and necessity.</li> <li>Humans have become far too afraid of death and fight it too often. People must learn to accept death. People are too focused on science and technological improvement but have lost sight of necessity. All we need is what we need to survive. I’m not quite sure it’s possible to completely eliminate human suffering. It seems that there is a equilibrium built into nature that we partake of. There is only so much pain we can experience and only so much pleasure. The ‘best’ scale for experiencing the world is a logarithmic one. Log is built into nature. The corona virus illuminates the future of complete seclusion, a property that is already plauging young individuals, facilitated by the internet. ‘Accepting’ your current position, no matter how good or bad, seems to bring you to a new baseline of experience. The ‘four noble truths of buddhism’ highlights this. Depression manifests as physical pain. Isolation seems to be a trigger for depression. How much better off are we? What does ‘better’ even refer to? Consumerism attitude is a virus.</li> <li>Isolation seems to be a large factor in human behaviour and seems to stem from humans being largely social creatures (with exceptions).

Disrupt of almost any industry.<br> Reduced agregate demand. As consumers make less, there will be lower demand, and lower B2C. Primary businesses will revolve around B2B and B2Government.<br> Wealth can become demolished.</p> <h2 id="industries-that-persist">Industries that persist</h2> <p>Food, water, energy<br> Automation robotics (build the tools that build the tools).

Making sure people don’t use too many resources. A universal clicker that ensures everyone gets the same, and any consolidation is negatively compounding, opposite to capatilistic society. This is a natural solution to the resource distribution problem, makes sure everyone has equality of resource, as there is no longer a need to incentivize production. People are incentivized to make the most of the resources they have.</p> <h1 id="energy">Energy</h1> <ul> <li>Fusion energy</li> <li>Battery</li> <li>Fossil Fuels -&gt; Electricity -&gt; ?</li> <li>What are some downfalls of Electricity? <ul> <li>Loses power over time</li> </ul> </li> <li>Solar Panels <ul> <li>Efficient conversion of solar energy (much moreso than plants)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2 id="fusion-power">Fusion power</h2> <p>Costs 10s to 100s of billions to research and ultimately build some form of successful fusion reactor. Solar panels already generate free electricity. Materials is the primary concern. A fusion power can create clean water but how does it transport? Battery technology limits planes and boats. This is still better than solar power, as where it is most efficient is deserts is where there is no water.</p> <p>Can’t create any resources as, just in terms of energy requirements, stars aren’t capable of fusing iron together, it requires intense gravitational collapse to create heavier elements. In addition to that there is the complexity of accurately generating a practical amount of resources. Stars don’t have an infinite amount of energy, their energy is not necessarily sufficient to create sufficient resources.</p> <h1 id="resources">Resources</h1> <ul> <li>https://www.un.org/en/global-issues</li> <li>[10 AI Predictions for 2024]{ref=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWO9OJUeouE&amp;list=WL&amp;index=30; resource=website;}</li> </ul> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/my-personal-notes/">My personal notes</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/my-favorite-pieces-of-music/">My favorite pieces of music</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/how-to-learn/">How to learn</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/music-insanity/">Music Insanity</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/music-scales/">Music Scales</a> </li> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Trey Wilkinson.
