Brain is a map of experience. It builds models of the information it is fed. Information generally most useful when complex connections are understood. Encoding and retrieval are two sides of the same coin. You can do both. Encode high-level understanding and retrieve those high level concepts spaced, interleaved, in different contexts, etc.</p> <p>You need to spend time both deeply learning foundational concepts, but also getting a broad understanding of a variety of concepts. Each are very important ways to develop contexts in which to relate other concepts. There is a big difference between limited knowledge, and broad shallow knowledge. Be comfortable ignoring details in pursuit of a broad shallow knowledge. Be comfortable ignoring various details to deeply understand one idea.</p> <p>Taxonomies:</p> <ul> <li>My taxonomy: isolation -&gt; context -&gt; groups in context -&gt; compare groups in same context -&gt; compare groups in different contexts <ul> <li>Understand how a concept is constructed under different goals of understanding a concept</li> <li>Understand each construction (particularly the chosen context) in a larger context and how they all relate to each other</li> </ul> </li> <li>Blooms taxonomy: remember -&gt; understand -&gt; apply -&gt; analyze -&gt; evaluate -&gt; create</li> <li>SOLO taxonomy: pre-structural -&gt; uni-structural -&gt; multi-structural -&gt; relational -&gt; extended abstract</li> </ul> <h1 id="encoding">Encoding</h1> <p>The key to finding the right encoding method, is to understand how the brain stores, represents, recalls, and utilizes information. Although, regardless of whatever low-level mechanisms the brain uses to manage information, storing information in terms of how you want to use it is the best strategy.</p> <p>An alternative to contexts is developing graph knowledge, and attaching information to relationships.</p> <p>Encode knowledge in as much complexity as soon as possible.<br> Don’t really need to spend as much time on the lower levels of learning.<br> Focus on higher level thinking. You will need to fill in the rest of the dots necessarily to reach the goal.<br> Prestudy: before your study session, prepare your mind. plan out where things will go, etc. prime it.<br> Writing notes lets your brain immediately forget and offload to the paper. you’re not really learning anything.<br> When reading papers: Group words, isolate key words. Take breaks to understand what you just read and how it fits with everything else.</p> <p>Encoding types:</p> <ul> <li>Levels of abstractions: each level has concepts at certain level of abstraction</li> <li>Probes: Functors from a category point, graph, sequence, tree, discrete collection, etc. to the encoding category</li> <li>Tree with root at highest level of abstraction</li> </ul> <p>How to think: abstract Information. Have a list of information or textual data. Combine abstract data through a graph and sequential structure. On one level, have a graph relating abstract structures or contexts that are well understood. Separately, have a graph of concepts, definitions, etc. Associate these graphs with each other. Infact, there can be a hierarchy of graphs with differing levels of abstraction, each overlapping the other. Additionally, you pick out a tree or graph from these layerings of abstraction, and chunk those together. Then treat those chunks as their own concept to include reciprically in the previous relationships. Balance Precise formal understanding, visual, generalized, definitions, vocabulary, etc. These modals each have their own graph as well as interplay between concept structures.</p> <h1 id="contexts">Contexts</h1> <p>Break the concept into a category. Categories allow exploring the structure of a context, so you look at various categories. Then you find a way of comparing these structures. Because concepts should form a sort of limit, you can embed multiple of these limits inside the same category, and still have access to objects and morphisms. You then form 1-cells to compare objects and 2-cells to compare morphisms.</p> <p>Break a concept into subconcepts, under various contexts. In other words, identify the structure of a concept under various contexts. With all the contexts and their substructures, create a graph structure relating everything. In particular the contexts and how their structures relate to each other. This is all in order to learn the structure of a concept. Next step is to identify how the concept relates to structures of other concepts under various contexts. In other words, repeat the first stage, but at a level higher.</p> <p>Contexts provide the underlying frame of reference or embedding space for concepts. Develop a solid understanding of the embedding space and relative relationships between various concepts that can be placed in these embedding spaces. People either develop these spaces through establishing relation to existing concepts, or by building the contexts and placing concepts within these.</p> <p>Learning a concept in multiple contexts or multiple ways is like building redundant information. Like stripes in a RAID system. If you forget a chunk of information, you still have enough to fill the gaps. Each context is like a separate hook or pointer for finding the concept. A concept is “remembered” forever, you just need the hooks to find it again. If you distribute a large amount of hooks around, you never forget the idea.</p> <p>Some contexts include: vocabulary (synonyms, antonymns, making sentences, etymology), abstractions (category theory, topos theory, calculus, etc.), history, examples, how something is contructed, applications, related ideas, resources (citations, authors), visu</p> <p><strong>Vocabulary</strong>: Start by defining key terms related to the concept. This will create a foundation for your understanding and help you communicate effectively about the topic.<br> <strong>History</strong>: Understanding the historical context of a concept can provide insights into its development, evolution, and the reasons behind its existence. Learning about key figures, events, and milestones can deepen your grasp of the concept.<br> <strong>Examples</strong>: Real-life examples can bring abstract concepts to life. They illustrate how the concept is applied in different situations, making it easier to understand and remember.<br> <strong>Applications</strong>: Explore how the concept is used in various fields or industries. Understanding its practical applications can help you see its relevance and importance in the real world.<br> <strong>Structure</strong>: If the concept has a structured framework or model, understanding this structure can provide a roadmap for organizing your thoughts. It can also help you identify relationships between different components of the concept.<br> <strong>Analogies</strong>: Drawing parallels between the concept and something you already understand well can accelerate your learning. Analogies make new information relatable by linking it to familiar ideas.<br> <strong>Visualizations</strong>: Creating diagrams, mind maps, flowcharts, or other visual aids can help you visually represent the concept’s components and relationships. Visualizations are particularly helpful for understanding complex systems.<br> <strong>Comparisons and Contrasts</strong>: Compare the concept with similar or related ideas, highlighting their similarities and differences. This can clarify nuances and help you grasp the concept more deeply.<br> <strong>Problem Solving</strong>: Apply the concept to solve problems or answer questions. Practical engagement can solidify your understanding and highlight areas where you need further clarification.<br> <strong>Discussion and Teaching</strong>: Engage in discussions or even teach the concept to someone else. Explaining the concept in your own words forces you to consolidate your understanding and identify gaps in your knowledge.<br> <strong>Critique and Analysis</strong>: Evaluate the strengths and limitations of the concept. This critical thinking helps you develop a more well-rounded perspective and understand its practical boundaries.<br> <strong>Personal Reflection</strong>: Consider how the concept relates to your personal experiences or beliefs. This can create a more meaningful connection to the material. How does it resonate with your personal journey, challenges, and achievements?<br> <strong>Future Trends</strong>: Research how the concept might evolve in the future. Are there emerging trends, technologies, or shifts that could impact its relevance or application?<br> <strong>Interdisciplinary Connections</strong>: Identify how the concept connects to other fields of knowledge. Cross-disciplinary insights can provide fresh perspectives and lead to innovative applications.<br> <strong>Historical Context</strong>: Delve deeper into the historical backdrop of the concept. What societal, technological, or cultural factors influenced its emergence and development?<br> <strong>Language and Communication</strong>: Consider how the concept is communicated across different languages and communication mediums. Does its interpretation change in different linguistic or cultural contexts?<br> <strong>Counterexamples</strong>: Look for instances where the concept doesn’t apply or breaks down. Understanding these exceptions can refine your understanding of the concept’s boundaries.<br> <strong>Meta-Understanding</strong>: Reflect on your own understanding of the concept. How has your perspective evolved over time, and what gaps or uncertainties remain? This self-awareness can guide further learning.<br> <strong>Emotional Impact</strong>: Consider the emotional aspects tied to the concept. Does it evoke certain emotions or reactions? How might emotions influence its interpretation and application?<br> <strong>Global Perspective</strong>: Investigate how the concept is understood and used in different regions of the world. Global viewpoints can enrich your understanding and provide insights into cultural diversity.</p> <p><strong>Evolution of Definitions</strong>: Analyze how the definition and understanding of the concept have changed over time. This can reveal shifts in societal attitudes and knowledge.<br> <strong>Cross-Cultural Adaptation</strong>: Explore how the concept has been adapted and integrated into various cultures. This can highlight its universality or its adaptability to specific contexts.<br> <strong>Cultural Context</strong>: Explore how the concept is perceived and utilized in different cultures and societies. Cultural nuances can impact the interpretation and application of a concept.<br> <strong>Ethical Considerations</strong>: Investigate the ethical implications of the concept. How does it align with ethical principles, and are there any ethical dilemmas associated with its use?</p> <h1 id="core-ideas">Core ideas</h1> <ul> <li>Identify your struggles <ul> <li>Something that holds you back from your goals</li> </ul> </li> <li>Identify your strengths.

We represent the same information in a lot of different ways or contexts. By representing information this way, there is a lot of redundancy. As such, one can reconstruct information if one forgets some. Similar to how RAID memory works. I believe this is similar to the thousand brains theory of intelligence. Given that knowledge is highly contextual, information of a certain concept highly depends on context so it makes sense to extract the information contextually. This is where the power of abstractions come in. The better at abstracting, the more contexts one can relate the concept to. One can essentially build more redudancy out of a concept. However this doesn’t become helpful until there are already a lot of concepts in the brain.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Identify what you’re learning, and what the underlying ideas behind it is. Master the more abstract, lower concepts, and similar ideas at same level of abstraction to get your brain to learn a solid abstraction of the concept you’re learning. That will make that specific case better, and you can quickly learn similar ideas in the future.

To learn charisma. Learn how to read them. Learn to read youself. Pay attention to when you form/change opinions on others. Watch for peoples attention. What directs their attention. Engaged questions. A lot of information of emotion comes from facial/vocal expression. Microexpression. Identifying patterns. Make predictions. Experiment.</p> <h1 id="self-teaching">Self teaching</h1> <p>One of the most difficult challenges of self teaching is identifying what you don’t know, holes in your knowledge, and/or developing a study plan. A useful strategy for identify what to learn is to think about what framework of thinking is necessary for discovering this/understanding this concept?</p> <p>Limiting yourself to equation solutions is a very limited way to learn. By learning other ways to validate your knowledge, you drastically expand learnable skills.</p> <p>Reflect upon how you have to think in order to reach a more optimal state. A constant process of self-reflection will lead you to developing the necessary techniques to effectively self learn. If you’re trying to solve a problem, but you don’t know enough, and have to keep going back to learn various concepts from the same source, you can deduce: if I can beforehand determine if there are any resources that include most relevant information to a problem, then I should consider internalizing it such that I can have a more focused and productive problem solving session.</p> <p>The focused approach has flaws. When you don’t crystalize prerequisite knowledge before hand, you leave yourself to building understanding through unfinished thoughts and ideas from prerequisite knowledge. There is something to be said about a complete understanding of a subject and knowing that many things are for certain not true rather than having decent certainty that something is true.</p> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/my-personal-notes/">My personal notes</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/my-favorite-pieces-of-music/">My favorite pieces of music</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/music-insanity/">Music Insanity</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/music-scales/">Music Scales</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/deep-learning/">Deep Learning</a> </li> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Trey Wilkinson.
