Instead, learn difficult technical pieces like Liszt and Chopin etudes, and master them completely. afterward develop general techniques for other roots, chords, and scales. other than learning pieces, focus on memorizing scales and chords.</p> <p>A big part of chord technique is memorizing and developing natural capacity to open the hand to correct orientation. select chords that have troubled you, and break them down in every way (jumping from every combination of interval to every combination of intervals in every sequence on every combination of left and right hand, master all dynamics, etc). master the technique before really trying to learn every chord, it will greatly speed the process and make it more reliable.</p> <p>practice should consist of in-depth chord/scale practice considering all inversions and omissions etc, technique practice where you aim for speed and precision, and memorization of as many scales and chords</p> <p>finger independence pactice is also about playing chords and intervals and internalizing the different finger movements</p> <p>use liszt etudes to cover every technique, afterward generalize to various chorss and scales. just focus on memorizing chords and scales.</p> <p>the “if you can play it slow you can play it fast” mantra is relevant primarily when learning pieces that are well within technical capabilities. Developing technical capabilities however should be considered like working out and stretching, you must push yourself to edge of failure. slow practice is like learning to aim a bow woth varying degrees of force, low force requires different mechanics than high force, but both need to be mastered to master piano.</p> <p>app that selects a random scale. random sequence of degrees, random sequence of chord inversions, rhythms</p> <p>optimal technique results in minimal movement of wrist and fingers. smoothest possible movement. minimize work fingers need to do. rhythm groupings become somewhat unnecessary when you master scales amd chords amd technique, they teach you to plwy a sequence in awkward and impractical chunks, you wouldnt normally get in certain positions and they lead to clunky playing</p> <p>double note sxale play sequence in one scale then jump along sequence in other scale</p> <p>Music harmony has issues. Scales and chords are not the right way to think about these. There are collections of notes that serve as a backbone or structures, there are sequences of backbones or structures, then there are notes played simultaneously mostly taken from a backbone. There are ways to realize or voice sequences and simultaneous notes. The structures have various harmonic relationships. Hierarchical layers of related structures. Structures don’t necessarily have direct restriction relationships. Or think of it as the intersection of possible overlapping structures of each structure as the fundamental musical context. Don’t look at identifying related structures reductively, but additively. At every level there are breaks from the structure.</p> <p>I should aim for Liszt’s transcendental etudes or hamelins etudes (and learning more pieces in general). in addition to memorizing chords and scales, it is important to connect it through pieces and for learning techniques harder to generalize in excercises. Take learning pieces as a skill, just like sight reading, the ability to quickly take a piece you just sight read, abstract parts, understand the techniques, harmonies, and purpose of notes, know what dynamics and timing to use, and to formalize everything into memorizable chunks and quickly play it is a skill.</p> <p>register: very important to voicings. higher registers permit denser chords, lower registers permit spacier chords. think of the overtone series.</p> <p>you can get away with dissonance with good voice leading</p> <p>chord function is more relevant than chord quality.</p> <p>to learn: break it into simplest bits of information then combine it like the partial order of a powerset. isolate into generalizable chunks, and master the most generalizable. hence why i prioritize chords.</p> <p>things to improvise: octaves (scale or chord progression like hung rhapsody ending, mazeppa), finger indp like feux follets or ondine descending notes. franz liszt is perhaps best influence for things I want to improvise. <br> study jacob collier music</p> <p>scales are fake news. you can start the harmony from chords and let scales flow from there, chords dont have to come from the scale. free yourself. move chords around without reference to scale. leave the chord however you feel like.</p> <p>melodies, chords, intervals, or scales can be first class citizens. it depends on the harmony and sound you’re going for. isolate the sound or harmony you’re working in and build from there.</p> <p>voice leading: think of moving subshape through a sequence (voice leading). different voices can follow different sequences generated from different shapes</p> <p>polyrhythm for melody. offset one melody, repeat melody as you are finishing up the original.</p> <p>think of modes and harmonies as specifying notes, mapping of chords to collection of the notes such that all chords give a piece of characteristic sound for the mode. i dont have time to learn all scales or chords so i should focus on the music i want to perform. the harmony also includes how one diverges from harmony like alterations, additional chords used.</p> <p>Pools of notes specify the collection of notes, and therefore the intervals. A harmony specifies particular central notes (the root in particular) and other key intervals. Chords containing those key intervals in combination with the key notes give the characteristic harmonic sounds. One can leave the harmony for increased harmonic direction.</p> <p>There are note pools or inventories (like scales) and there are formations on those pools, called shapes and sequences. Taking thirds builds classical chord shapes. The pools have meaning once a harmony is selected and how the resulting pool from a base note relates to the harmony.</p> <p>The goal is to internalize a large sum of patterns, such that I just need to quickly map sheet music to my pattern space and memorize that mapping.</p> <p>The music you make depends on your training, studies, things you learn, and patterns learned. Learn patterns that lead to the music you want to develop, which facilitates thinking about music, harmony, melody, and rhythm the way you want to. What kind of music do I realistically want to play? Jazz, classical, compose? I like the creative aspect of music and improvisational ability. I like complex harmonies and interesting rhythms. I should learn jazz, but incorporate harmonies and textures from classical so that I can apply them to various chords or rhythms. Also to be able to show off flashy pieces. <br> I should prioritize scale and chord knowledge. play through all chords in a scale with various voicings (thirds, fourths, split left and right hand) then I can start separating techniques generated from different harmonies <br> need separation of harmony, technique, and rhythm. learn to quickly switch between combinations of each domain (melody/harmony, technique and embellishments, rhythm, dynamics).</p> <p>I see myself picking interesting textures from classical pieces and incorporating them into jazz, learning them in various harmonic contexts and improvising melodies over them. How can I use advanced classical textures like double thirds to create unique jazzy music that is otherwise better than its simple counterpart. That is, how can I best harmonize with the virtuosity I have developed but not make it overwhelming or out of place?</p> <p>To find my style, I must find scales that I particularly like and master those. I can’t master every scale. <br> Scales: I like non-tonal scales, double harmonic major, scales with minor third jumps, mixture of major/minor scale. Rhythm <br> Chords: tertian harmony, polytonality <br> Texture: ravel-like textures <br> Melody and themes: introduction of various themes, simplification of themes or combination of other themes</p> <p>https://www.scales-chords.com/scaleinfo.php?skey=C\&amp;sname=double+harmonic</p> <h2 id="harmony">Harmony</h2> <h3 id="jazz-harmony">Jazz harmony</h3> <p>X∆7: 3 7 9 #11 13 <br> X-7: b3 b7 9 11 13 <br> X7: 3 b7 b9 9 #9 #11 b13 13 <br> X-7b5: b3 b7 b5 <br> X7#5: 3 b7 #5 <br> X-<strong>∆</strong>7: b3 7 <br> X9sus: 11 b7 9 <br> Xsusb9: 11 b7 b9 <br> X-b6: b3 b6</p> <h2 id="technique-variation">Technique variation</h2> <p>Dotted rhythm and similar variations.

Master it, do it quickly amd smoothly for all intervals through all shapes <br> hold one finger on piano key and move other finger between two notes (great for 45 and 34 and 345). make sound quality very consistent <br> play interval descending n degrees through scale after n jump an octave and continue <br> Trills and tremelos between all combinations of fingers (1 finger to 1 finger and 1 finger to 2 fingers)</p> <p>For every combination of fingers repeated as fast as possible, then try it with some rhythm, combine both hands, do a different rhythm per hand or different finger combination, alternate between finger combinations, try with mixture of legato staccato and marcato <br> Hold n fingers constant and alternate between the other fingers <br> Where letters represent fingers 1-5: abe ab abd ab abc, abe ab ae abd ab ad abc ab ac <br> Where numbers index combinations in left hand and letter index combinations in right hand: 1a 1b 2b, 1a 1b 2a 1b 1a 2b</p> <p>Double notes: trill one voice and every 3 notes play the other voice <br> Chopin op. 10 no. 2: left and right hand <br> Chopin op. 25 no. 6: some fingerings are 14-25 13-25 24-15 13-24 <br> Liszt op. 139 no. 5 (transcendental etude feux follets): play the high voice legato and low voice staccato</p> <p><strong>Wrist rotation</strong> <br> playing neighboring notes, 51 511 5111 15 155 1555 1515, 54 legato</p> <h3 id="shape-piece">Shape piece</h3> <p>For shapes built from a small number of small intervals <br> Play as grace notes in some sequence land on the final note repeat the pattern by a sequence</p> <h3 id="chord">Chord</h3> <p>Foundations: chords made of intervals, chords based on scale degrees, chord symbols <br> Alterations: sus, 6 chords, replacing notes, omitting notes (power chords, less tension), adding notes <br> Processing speed: alternate base notes, stacking chords (easier to process than complex chord symbols), polychords</p> <p>Memorize all 3 and 4 note chords, then learn how to play any technique given any 3 or 4 note chord. <br> Chords with similar intervals sound similar (minor and major) and there is less ability to distinguish them. <br> internalize each chord, then learn which chords go to each scale <br> <strong>Chords:</strong> <br> Start with min maj dim aug dim7 min7b5 min7 maj7 dom aug7 minmaj7 <br> trichord, tetrachord, every secundal chord of 3 notes, octaves with interval, every interval <br> 12 × 12 (mm Mm mM MM mmm mMm mmM mMM Mmm MMm MmM MMM) × 6inv + 12 × 5 (min maj dim aug sus2 sus4) × 3inv + 12 × 9 (min7 dim dimo maj7 min∆7 dom aug∆7 aug7 minaug∆7) × 8inv.</p> <p><strong>Memorize chords:</strong> <br> Internalize every modification (sharp and flat), their sub chord, and their inversions, and their chromatic movement along any scale. Arpeggios, finger exercises, jumps from n fingers, combine hands, jump to inverted and shifted chord <br> Treat like sight reading: pick chord quality and inversion for each hand, move each hand through sequence playing that chord eventually changing the inversion and octave everytime. Load as much as you can into working memory, play as quickly as possible allowing a few mistakes (just like sight reading). <br> also change chord qualities every chord from arbitrary sequence <br> play each chord in shape <br> for a shape, play chord in shape then move one note forward (normally right most finger then second right most or 2 right most notes or other patterns) be aware of what chord and inversion is going to be next <br> play chord progression. once resolve change next target chord by sequence (chord progression, scale, chromatic)</p> <p>chord, inversion, left and right hand jumps to inversions contrary and parallel, octave movements, interval jumps and movements, inversions more than an octave <br> <strong>Chord techniques</strong> (the following with every combination between hands in parallel and contrary): inversion (root to 1 to 2 and root to 2 to 1) both within an octave and more than an octave (135 -&gt; 153 or 145 -&gt; 4 1 5) (for inversions name chord based on new root), jumps, note accents and even playing, broken chords, arpeggios, arpeggios with doubled notes, finger independence, various octaves on sequences built from chords, chromatic movements, alternate chord sequence with both hands, repeated notes, grace chords (a la prokofiev), alternate between two chords or arpeggios, play chord doubling the lowest note but play the middle notes an octave lower or higher (mereaux), play chord with highest or lowest note trill using a scale to connect notes in chord using chord notes as target notes, jumping n fingers along inversions or other jumps, playing outer octave and inner tremolo while inverting and shifting chord, arpeggio while chromatically shifting chord or inverting it <br> <strong>Connecting chords:</strong> play chord jumping through all intervals (1 through 16 semitones and multiple octaves), play same chord changing root from sequence of shape, play all chords built from 2s 3s 4s of pool, what chords are closely associated to which scales, also how to move from one chord to another, what voicings connect what chords, what sequences connect what chords, what chords are harmonically similar, functional roles of chords.
